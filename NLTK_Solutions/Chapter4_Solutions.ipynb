company few parties chiefly among single men had already taken place regular best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume invite -- neither Donwell nor Hartfield nor Randalls Nothing should tempt _her_ go if they did regretted father \\' s known habits would giving refusal less meaning than could wish Coles were very respectable their way but they ought taught for them arrange terms on which superior families would visit them This lesson very much feared they would receive only from herself had little hope Mr Knightley none Mr Weston But had made up mind how meet this
