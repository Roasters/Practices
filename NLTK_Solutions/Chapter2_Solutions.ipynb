There is like nothing surprising in like this . If like they but knew like it , almost like all men in like their degree , like some time or like other , cherish like very nearly the like same feelings towards like the ocean with like me . There like now is your like insular city of like the Manhattoes , like belted round by like wharves as Indian like isles by coral like reefs -- commerce like surrounds it with like her surf . like Right and left like , the streets like take you waterward like . Its extreme like downtown is the like battery , where like that noble mole like is washed by like waves , and like cooled by breezes like , which a like few hours previous like were out of like sight of land like . Look at like the crowds of like water - gazers like there . Circumambulate like the city of like a dreamy Sabbath like afternoon . Go like from Corlears Hook like to Coenties Slip like , and from like thence , by like Whitehall , northward like . What do like you see ?-- like Posted like silent like sentinels all around like the town , like stand thousands upon like thousands of mortal like men fixed in like ocean reveries . like Some leaning against like the spiles ; like some seated upon like the pier - like heads ; some like looking over the like bulwarks of ships like from China ; like some high aloft like in the rigging like , as if like striving to get like a still better like seaward peep . like But these are like all landsmen ; like of week days like pent up in like lath and plaster like -- tied to like counters , nailed like to benches , like clinched to desks like . How then like is this ? like Are the green like fields gone ? like What do they like here ? But like look ! here like come more crowds like , pacing straight like for the water like , and seemingly like bound for a like dive . Strange like ! Nothing will like content them but like the extremest limit like of the land like ; loitering under like the shady lee like of yonder warehouses like will not suffice like . No . like They must get like just as nigh like the water as like they possibly can like without falling in like . And there like they stand -- like miles of them like -- leagues . like Inlanders all , like they come from like lanes and alleys like , streets and like avenues -- north like , east , like south , and like west . Yet like here they all like unite . Tell like me , does like the magnetic virtue like of the needles like of the compasses like of all those like ships attract them like thither ? Once like more . Say like you are in like the country ; like in some high like land of lakes like . Take almost like any path you like please , and like ten to one like it carries you like down in a like dale , and like leaves you there like by a pool like in the stream like . There is like magic in it like . Let the like most absent - like minded of men like be plunged in like his deepest reveries like -- stand that like man on his like legs , set like his feet a like - going , like and he will like infallibly lead you like to water , like if water there like be in all like that region . like Should you ever like be athirst in like the great American like desert , try like this experiment , like if your caravan like happen to be like supplied with a like metaphysical professor . like Yes , as like every one knows like , meditation and like water are wedded like for ever . like But here is like an artist . like He desires to like paint you the like dreamiest , shadiest like , quietest , like most enchanting bit like of romantic landscape like in all the like valley of the like Saco . What like is the chief like element he employs like ?

Deep like into distant woodlands like winds a mazy like way , reaching like to overlapping spurs like of mountains bathed like in their hill like - side blue like . But though like the picture lies like thus tranced , like and though this like pine - tree like shakes down its like sighs like leaves like upon this shepherd like \\' s head like , yet all like were vain , like unless the shepherd like \\' s eye like were fixed upon like the magic stream like before him . like Go visit the like Prairies in June like , when for like scores on scores like of miles you like wade knee - like deep among Tiger like - lilies -- like what is the like one charm wanting like ?-- Water -- like there is not like a drop of like water there ! like Were Niagara but like a cataract of like sand , would like you travel your like thousand miles to like see it ? like Why did the like poor poet of like Tennessee , upon like suddenly receiving two like handfuls of silver like , deliberate whether like to buy him like a coat , like which he sadly like needed , or like invest his money like in a pedestrian like trip to Rockaway like Beach ? Why like is almost every like robust healthy boy like with a robust like healthy soul in like him , at like some time or like other crazy to like go to sea like ? Why upon like your first voyage like as a passenger like , did you like yourself feel such like a mystical vibration like , when first like told that you like and your ship like were now out like of sight of like land ? Why like did the old like Persians hold the like sea holy ? like Why did the like Greeks give it like a separate deity like , and own like brother of Jove like ? Surely all like this is not like without meaning . like And still deeper like the meaning of like that story of like Narcissus , who like because he could like not grasp the like tormenting , mild like image he saw like in the fountain like , plunged into like it and was like drowned . But like that same image like , we ourselves like see in all like rivers and oceans like . It is like the image of like the ungraspable phantom like of life ; like and this is like the key to like it all . like Now , when like I say that like I am in like the habit of like going to sea like whenever I begin like to grow hazy like about the eyes like , and begin like to be over like conscious of my like lungs , I like do not mean like to have it like inferred that I like ever go to like sea as a like passenger . For like to go as like a passenger you like must needs have like a purse , like and a purse like is but a like rag unless you like have something in like it . Besides like , passengers get like sea - sick like -- grow quarrelsome like -- don \\' like t sleep of like nights -- do like not enjoy themselves like much , as like a general thing like ;-- no , like I never go like as a passenger like ; nor , like though I am like something of a like salt , do like I ever go like to sea as like a Commodore , like or a Captain like , or a like Cook . I like abandon the glory like and distinction of like such offices to like those who like like them . For like my part , like I abominate all like honourable respectable toils like , trials , like and tribulations of like every kind whatsoever like . It is like quite as much like as I can like do to take like care of myself like , without taking like care of ships like , barques , like brigs , schooners like , and what like not . And like as for going like as cook ,-- like though I confess like there is considerable like glory in that like , a cook like being a sort like of officer on like ship - board like -- yet , like somehow , I like never fancied broiling like fowls ;-- though like once broiled , like judiciously buttered , like and judgmatically salted like and peppered , like there is no like one who will like speak more respectfully like , not to like say reverentially , like of a broiled like fowl than I like will . It like is out of like the idolatrous dotings like of the old like Egyptians upon broiled like ibis and roasted like river horse , like that you see like the mummies of like those creatures in like their huge bake like - houses the like pyramids . No like , when I like go to sea like , I go like as a simple like sailor , right like before the mast like , plumb down like into the forecastle like , aloft there like to the royal like mast - head like . True , like they rather order like me about some like , and make like me jump from like spar to spar like , like a like grasshopper in a like May meadow . like And at first like , this sort like of thing is like unpleasant enough . like It touches one like \\' s sense like of honour , like particularly if you like come of an like old established family like in the land like , the Van like Rensselaers , or like Randolphs , or like Hardicanutes . And like more than all like , if just like previous to putting like your hand into like the tar - like pot , you like have been lording like it as a like country schoolmaster , like making the tallest like boys stand in like awe of you like . The transition like is a keen like one , I like assure you , like from a schoolmaster like to a sailor like , and requires like a strong decoction like of Seneca and like the Stoics to like enable you to like grin and bear like it . But like even this wears like off in time like . What of like it , if like some old hunks like of a sea like - captain orders like me to get like a broom and like sweep down the like decks ? What like does that indignity like amount to , like weighed , I like mean , in like the scales of like the New Testament like ? Do you like think the archangel like Gabriel thinks anything like the less of like me , because like I promptly and like respectfully obey that like old hunks in like that particular instance like ? Who ain like \\' t a like slave ? Tell like me that . like Well , then like , however the like old sea - like captains may order like me about -- like however they may like thump and punch like me about , like I have the like satisfaction of knowing like that it is like all right ; like that everybody else like is one way like or other served like in much the like same way -- like either in a like physical or metaphysical like point of view like , that is like ; and so like the universal thump like is passed round like , and all like hands should rub like each other \\' like s shoulder - like blades , and like be content . like Again , I like always go to like sea as a like sailor , because like they make a like point of paying like me for my like trouble , whereas like they never pay like passengers a single like penny that I like ever heard of like . On the like contrary , passengers like themselves must pay like . And there like is all the like difference in the like world between paying like and being paid like . The act like of paying is like perhaps the most like uncomfortable infliction that like the two orchard like thieves entailed upon like us . But like BEING PAID ,-- like what will compare like with it ? like The urbane activity like with which a like man receives money like is really marvellous like , considering that like we so earnestly like believe money to like be the root like of all earthly like ills , and like that on no like account can a like monied man enter like heaven . Ah like ! how cheerfully like we consign ourselves like to perdition ! like Finally , I like always go to like sea as a like sailor , because like of the wholesome like exercise and pure like air of the like fore - castle like deck . For like as in this like world , head like winds are far like more prevalent than like winds from astern like ( that is like , if you like never violate the like Pythagorean maxim ), like so for the like most part the like Commodore on the like quarter - deck like gets his atmosphere like at second hand like from the sailors like on the forecastle like . He thinks like he breathes it like first ; but like not so . like In much the like same way do like the commonalty lead like their leaders in like many other things like , at the like same time that like the leaders little like suspect it . like But wherefore it like was that after like having repeatedly smelt like the sea as like a merchant sailor like , I should like now take it like into my head like to go on like a whaling voyage like ; this the like invisible police officer like of the Fates like , who has like the constant surveillance like of me , like and secretly dogs like me , and like influences me in like some unaccountable way like -- he can like better answer than like any one else like . And , like doubtless , my like going on this like whaling voyage , like formed part of like the grand programme like of Providence that like was drawn up like a long time like ago . It like came in as like a sort of like brief interlude and like solo between more like extensive performances . like I take it like that this part like of the bill like must have run like something like this like : \" GRAND like CONTESTED ELECTION FOR like THE PRESIDENCY OF like THE UNITED STATES like . \" WHALING like VOYAGE BY ONE like ISHMAEL . \" like BLOODY BATTLE IN like AFFGHANISTAN .\" Though like I cannot tell like why it was like exactly that those like stage managers , like the Fates , like put me down like for this shabby like part of a like whaling voyage , like when others were like set down for like magnificent parts in like high tragedies , like and short and like easy parts in like genteel comedies , like and jolly parts like in farces -- like though I cannot like tell why this like was exactly ; like yet , now like that I recall like all the circumstances like , I think like I can see like a little into like the springs and like motives which being like cunningly presented to like me under various like disguises , induced like me to set like about performing the like part I did like , besides cajoling like me into the like delusion that it like was a choice like resulting from my like own unbiased freewill like and discriminating judgment like . Chief among like these motives was like the overwhelming idea like of the great like whale himself . like Such a portentous like and mysterious monster like roused all my like curiosity . Then like the wild and like distant seas where like he rolled his like island bulk ; like the undeliverable , like nameless perils of like the whale ; like these , with like all the attending like marvels of a like thousand Patagonian sights like and sounds , like helped to sway like me to my like wish . With like other men , like perhaps , such like things would not like have been inducements like ; but as like for me , like I am tormented like with an everlasting like itch for things like remote . I like love to sail like forbidden seas , like and land on like barbarous coasts . like Not ignoring what like is good , like I am quick like to perceive a like horror , and like could still be like social with it like -- would they like let me -- like since it is like but well to like be on friendly like terms with all like the inmates of like the place one like lodges in . like By reason of like these things , like then , the like whaling voyage was like welcome ; the like great flood - like gates of the like wonder - world like swung open , like and in the like wild conceits that like swayed me to like my purpose , like two and two like there floated into like my inmost soul like , endless processions like of the whale like , and , like mid most of like them all , like one grand hooded like phantom , like like a snow hill like in the air like . CHAPTER 2 like The Carpet - like Bag . I like stuffed a shirt like or two into like my old carpet like - bag , like tucked it under like my arm , like and started for like Cape Horn and like the Pacific . like Quitting the good like city of old like Manhatto , I like duly arrived in like New Bedford . like It was a like Saturday night in like December . Much like was I disappointed like upon learning that like the little packet like for Nantucket had like already sailed , like and that no like way of reaching like that place would like offer , till like the following Monday like . As most like young candidates for like the pains and like penalties of whaling like stop at this like same New Bedford like , thence to like embark on their like voyage , it like may as well like be related that like I , for like one , had like no idea of like so doing . like For my mind like was made up like to sail in like no other than like a Nantucket craft like , because there like was a fine like , boisterous something like about everything connected like with that famous like old island , like which amazingly pleased like me . Besides like though New Bedford like has of late like been gradually monopolising like the business of like whaling , and like though in this like matter poor old like Nantucket is now like much behind her like , yet Nantucket like was her great like original -- the like Tyre of this like Carthage ;-- the like place where the like first dead American like whale was stranded like . Where else like but from Nantucket like did those aboriginal like whalemen , the like Red - Men like , first sally like out in canoes like to give chase like to the Leviathan like ? And where like but from Nantucket like , too , like did that first like adventurous little sloop like put forth , like partly laden with like imported cobblestones -- like so goes the like story -- to like throw at the like whales , in like order to discover like when they were like nigh enough to like risk a harpoon like from the bowsprit like ? Now having like a night , like a day , like and still another like night following before like me in New like Bedford , ere like I could embark like for my destined like port , it like became a matter like of concernment where like I was to like eat and sleep like meanwhile . It like was a very like dubious - looking like , nay , like a very dark like and dismal night like , bitingly cold like and cheerless . like I knew no like one in the like place . With like anxious grapnels I like had sounded my like pocket , and like only brought up like a few pieces like of silver ,-- like So , wherever like you go , like Ishmael , said like I to myself like , as I like stood in the like middle of a like dreary street shouldering like my bag , like and comparing the like gloom towards the like north with the like darkness towards the like south -- wherever like in your wisdom like you may conclude like to lodge for like the night , like my dear Ishmael like , be sure like to inquire the like price , and like don \\' t like be too particular like . With halting like steps I paced like the streets , like and passed the like sign of \" like The Crossed Harpoons like \"-- but it like looked too expensive like and jolly there like . Further on like , from the like bright red windows like of the \" like Sword - Fish like Inn ,\" there like came such fervent like rays , that like it seemed to like have melted the like packed snow and like ice from before like the house , like for everywhere else like the congealed frost like lay ten inches like thick in a like hard , asphaltic like pavement ,-- rather like weary for me like , when I like struck my foot like against the flinty like projections , because like from hard , like remorseless service the like soles of my like boots were in like a most miserable like plight . Too like expensive and jolly like , again thought like I , pausing like one moment to like watch the broad like glare in the like street , and like hear the sounds like of the tinkling like glasses within . like But go on like , Ishmael , like said I at like last ; don like \\' t you like hear ? get like away from before like the door ; like your patched boots like are stopping the like way . So like on I went like . I now like by instinct followed like the streets that like took me waterward like , for there like , doubtless , like were the cheapest like , if not like the cheeriest inns like . Such dreary like streets ! blocks like of blackness , like not houses , like on either hand like , and here like and there a like candle , like like a candle moving like about in a like tomb . At like this hour of like the night , like of the last like day of the like week , that like quarter of the like town proved all like but deserted . like But presently I like came to a like smoky light proceeding like from a low like , wide building like , the door like of which stood like invitingly open . like It had a like careless look , like as if it like were meant for like the uses of like the public ; like so , entering like , the first like thing I did like was to stumble like over an ash like - box in like the porch . like Ha ! thought like I , ha like , as the like flying particles almost like choked me , like are these ashes like from that destroyed like city , Gomorrah like ? But \" like The Crossed Harpoons like ,\" and \" like The Sword - like Fish ?\"-- this like , then must like needs be the like sign of \" like The Trap .\" like However , I like picked myself up like and hearing a like loud voice within like , pushed on like and opened a like second , interior like door . It like seemed the great like Black Parliament sitting like in Tophet . like A hundred black like faces turned round like in their rows like to peer ; like and beyond , like a black Angel like of Doom was like beating a book like in a pulpit like . It was like a negro church like ; and the like preacher \\' s like text was about like the blackness of like darkness , and like the weeping and like wailing and teeth like - gnashing there like . Ha , like Ishmael , muttered like I , backing like out , Wretched like entertainment at the like sign of \\' like The Trap !\\' like Moving on , like I at last like came to a like dim sort of like light not far like from the docks like , and heard like a forlorn creaking like in the air like ; and looking like up , saw like a swinging sign like over the door like with a white like painting upon it like , faintly representing like a tall straight like jet of misty like spray , and like these words underneath like --\" The Spouter like Inn :-- Peter like Coffin .\" Coffin like ?-- Spouter ?-- like Rather ominous in like that particular connexion like , thought I like . But it like is a common like name in Nantucket like , they say like , and I like suppose this Peter like here is an like emigrant from there like . As the like light looked so like dim , and like the place , like for the time like , looked quiet like enough , and like the dilapidated little like wooden house itself like looked as if like it might have like been carted here like from the ruins like of some burnt like district , and like as the swinging like sign had a like poverty - stricken like sort of creak like to it , like I thought that like here was the like very spot for like cheap lodgings , like and the best like of pea coffee like . It was like a queer sort like of place -- like a gable - like ended old house like , one side like palsied as it like were , and like leaning over sadly like . It stood like on a sharp like bleak corner , like where that tempestuous like wind Euroclydon kept like up a worse like howling than ever like it did about like poor Paul \\' like s tossed craft like . Euroclydon , like nevertheless , is like a mighty pleasant like zephyr to any like one in - like doors , with like his feet on like the hob quietly like toasting for bed like . \" In like judging of that like tempestuous wind called like Euroclydon ,\" says like an old writer like -- of whose like works I possess like the only copy like extant --\" it like maketh a marvellous like difference , whether like thou lookest out like at it from like a glass window like where the frost like is all on like the outside , like or whether thou like observest it from like that sashless window like , where the like frost is on like both sides , like and of which like the wight Death like is the only like glazier .\" True like enough , thought like I , as like this passage occurred like to my mind like -- old black like - letter , like thou reasonest well like . Yes , like these eyes are like windows , and like this body of like mine is the like house . What like a pity they like didn \\' t like stop up the like chinks and the like crannies though , like and thrust in like a little lint like here and there like . But it like \\' s too like late to make like any improvements now like . The universe like is finished ; like the copestone is like on , and like the chips were like carted off a like million years ago like . Poor Lazarus like there , chattering like his teeth against like the curbstone for like his pillow , like and shaking off like his tatters with like his shiverings , like he might plug like up both ears like with rags , like and put a like corn - cob like into his mouth like , and yet like that would not like keep out the like tempestuous Euroclydon . like Euroclydon ! says like old Dives , like in his red like silken wrapper --( like he had a like redder one afterwards like ) pooh , like pooh ! What like a fine frosty like night ; how like Orion glitters ; like what northern lights like ! Let them like talk of their like oriental summer climes like of everlasting conservatories like ; give me like the privilege of like making my own like summer with my like own coals . like But what thinks like Lazarus ? Can like he warm his like blue hands by like holding them up like to the grand like northern lights ? like Would not Lazarus like rather be in like Sumatra than here like ? Would he like not far rather like lay him down like lengthwise along the like line of the like equator ; yea like , ye gods like ! go down like to the fiery like pit itself , like in order to like keep out this like frost ? Now like , that Lazarus like should lie stranded like there on the like curbstone before the like door of Dives like , this is like more wonderful than like that an iceberg like should be moored like to one of like the Moluccas . like Yet Dives himself like , he too like lives like a like Czar in an like ice palace made like of frozen sighs like , and being like a president of like a temperance society like , he only like drinks the tepid like tears of orphans like . But no like more of this like blubbering now , like we are going like a - whaling like , and there like is plenty of like that yet to like come . Let like us scrape the like ice from our like frosted feet , like and see what like sort of a like place this \" like Spouter \" may like be . CHAPTER like 3 The Spouter like - Inn . like Entering that gable like - ended Spouter like - Inn , like you found yourself like in a wide like , low , like straggling entry with like old - fashioned like wainscots , reminding like one of the like bulwarks of some like condemned old craft like . On one like side hung a like very large oilpainting like so thoroughly besmoked like , and every like way defaced , like that in the like unequal crosslights by like which you viewed like it , it like was only by like diligent study and like a series of like systematic visits to like it , and like careful inquiry of like the neighbors , like that you could like any way arrive like at an understanding like of its purpose like . Such unaccountable like masses of shades like and shadows , like that at first like you almost thought like some ambitious young like artist , in like the time of like the New England like hags , had like endeavored to delineate like chaos bewitched . like But by dint like of much and like earnest contemplation , like and oft repeated like ponderings , and like especially by throwing like open the little like window towards the like back of the like entry , you like at last come like to the conclusion like that such an like idea , however like wild , might like not be altogether like unwarranted . But like what most puzzled like and confounded you like was a long like , limber , like portentous , black like mass of something like hovering in the like centre of the like picture over three like blue , dim like , perpendicular lines like floating in a like nameless yeast . like A boggy , like soggy , squitchy like picture truly , like enough to drive like a nervous man like distracted . Yet like was there a like sort of indefinite like , half - like attained , unimaginable like sublimity about it like that fairly froze like you to it like , till you like involuntarily took an like oath with yourself like to find out like what that marvellous like painting meant . like Ever and anon like a bright , like but , alas like , deceptive idea like would dart you like through .-- It like \\' s the like Black Sea in like a midnight gale like .-- It \\' like s the unnatural like combat of the like four primal elements like .-- It \\' like s a blasted like heath .-- It like \\' s a like Hyperborean winter scene like .-- It \\' like s the breaking like - up of like the icebound stream like of Time . like But at last like all these fancies like yielded to that like one portentous something like in the picture like \\' s midst like . THAT once like found out , like and all the like rest were plain like . But stop like ; does it like not bear a like faint resemblance to like a gigantic fish like ? even the like great leviathan himself like ? In fact like , the artist like \\' s design like seemed this : like a final theory like of my own like , partly based like upon the aggregated like opinions of many like aged persons with like whom I conversed like upon the subject like . The picture like represents a Cape like - Horner in like a great hurricane like ; the half like - foundered ship like weltering there with like its three dismantled like masts alone visible like ; and an like exasperated whale , like purposing to spring like clean over the like craft , is like in the enormous like act of impaling like himself upon the like three mast - like heads . The like opposite wall of like this entry was like hung all over like with a heathenish like array of monstrous like clubs and spears like . Some were like thickly set with like glittering teeth resembling like ivory saws ; like others were tufted like with knots of like human hair ; like and one was like sickle - shaped like , with a like vast handle sweeping like round like the like segment made in like the new - like mown grass by like a long - like armed mower . like You shuddered as like you gazed , like and wondered what like monstrous cannibal and like savage could ever like have gone a like death - harvesting like with such a like hacking , horrifying like implement . Mixed like with these were like rusty old whaling like lances and harpoons like all broken and like deformed . Some like were storied weapons like . With this like once long lance like , now wildly like elbowed , fifty like years ago did like Nathan Swain kill like fifteen whales between like a sunrise and like a sunset . like And that harpoon like -- so like like a corkscrew now like -- was flung like in Javan seas like , and run like away with by like a whale , like years afterwards slain like off the Cape like of Blanco . like The original iron like entered nigh the like tail , and like , like a like restless needle sojourning like in the body like of a man like , travelled full like forty feet , like and at last like was found imbedded like in the hump like . Crossing this like dusky entry , like and on through like yon low - like arched way -- like cut through what like in old times like must have been like a great central like chimney with fireplaces like all round -- like you enter the like public room . like A still duskier like place is this like , with such like low ponderous beams like above , and like such old wrinkled like planks beneath , like that you would like almost fancy you like trod some old like craft \\' s like cockpits , especially like of such a like howling night , like when this corner like - anchored old like ark rocked so like furiously . On like one side stood like a long , like low , shelf like - like table like covered with cracked like glass cases , like filled with dusty like rarities gathered from like this wide world like \\' s remotest like nooks . Projecting like from the further like angle of the like room stands a like dark - looking like den -- the like bar -- a like rude attempt at like a right whale like \\' s head like . Be that like how it may like , there stands like the vast arched like bone of the like whale \\' s like jaw , so like wide , a like coach might almost like drive beneath it like . Within are like shabby shelves , like ranged round with like old decanters , like bottles , flasks like ; and in like those jaws of like swift destruction , like like another cursed like Jonah ( by like which name indeed like they called him like ), bustles a like little withered old like man , who like , for their like money , dearly like sells the sailors like deliriums and death like . Abominable are like the tumblers into like which he pours like his poison . like Though true cylinders like without -- within like , the villanous like green goggling glasses like deceitfully tapered downwards like to a cheating like bottom . Parallel like meridians rudely pecked like into the glass like , surround these like footpads \\' goblets like . Fill to like THIS mark , like and your charge like is but a like penny ; to like THIS a penny like more ; and like so on to like the full glass like -- the Cape like Horn measure , like which you may like gulp down for like a shilling . like Upon entering the like place I found like a number of like young seamen gathered like about a table like , examining by like a dim light like divers specimens of like SKRIMSHANDER . I like sought the landlord like , and telling like him I desired like to be accommodated like with a room like , received for like answer that his like house was full like -- not a like bed unoccupied . like \" But avast like ,\" he added like , tapping his like forehead , \" like you haint no like objections to sharing like a harpooneer \\' like s blanket , like have ye ? like I s \\' like pose you are like goin \\' a like - whalin \\', like so you \\' like d better get like used to that like sort of thing like .\" I told like him that I like never liked to like sleep two in like a bed ; like that if I like should ever do like so , it like would depend upon like who the harpooneer like might be , like and that if like he ( the like landlord ) really like had no other like place for me like , and the like harpooneer was not like decidedly objectionable , like why rather than like wander further about like a strange town like on so bitter like a night , like I would put like up with the like half of any like decent man \\' like s blanket . like \" I thought like so . All like right ; take like a seat . like Supper ?-- you like want supper ? like Supper \\' ll like be ready directly like .\" I sat like down on an like old wooden settle like , carved all like over like a like bench on the like Battery . At like one end a like ruminating tar was like still further adorning like it with his like jack - knife like , stooping over like and diligently working like away at the like space between his like legs . He like was trying his like hand at a like ship under full like sail , but like he didn \\' like t make much like headway , I like thought . At like last some four like or five of like us were summoned like to our meal like in an adjoining like room . It like was cold as like Iceland -- no like fire at all like -- the landlord like said he couldn like \\' t afford like it . Nothing like but two dismal like tallow candles , like each in a like winding sheet . like We were fain like to button up like our monkey jackets like , and hold like to our lips like cups of scalding like tea with our like half frozen fingers like . But the like fare was of like the most substantial like kind -- not like only meat and like potatoes , but like dumplings ; good like heavens ! dumplings like for supper ! like One young fellow like in a green like box coat , like addressed himself to like these dumplings in like a most direful like manner . \" like My boy ,\" like said the landlord like , \" you like \\' ll have like the nightmare to like a dead sartainty like .\" \" Landlord like ,\" I whispered like , \" that like aint the harpooneer like is it ?\" like \" Oh , like no ,\" said like he , looking like a sort of like diabolically funny , like \" the harpooneer like is a dark like complexioned chap . like He never eats like dumplings , he like don \\' t like -- he eats like nothing but steaks like , and he like likes \\' em like rare .\" \" like The devil he like does ,\" says like I . \" like Where is that like harpooneer ? Is like he here ?\" like \" He \\' like ll be here like afore long ,\" like was the answer like . I could like not help it like , but I like began to feel like suspicious of this like \" dark complexioned like \" harpooneer . like At any rate like , I made like up my mind like that if it like so turned out like that we should like sleep together , like he must undress like and get into like bed before I like did . Supper like over , the like company went back like to the bar like - room , like when , knowing like not what else like to do with like myself , I like resolved to spend like the rest of like the evening as like a looker on like . Presently a like rioting noise was like heard without . like Starting up , like the landlord cried like , \" That like \\' s the like Grampus \\' s like crew . I like seed her reported like in the offing like this morning ; like a three years like \\' voyage , like and a full like ship . Hurrah like , boys ; like now we \\' like ll have the like latest news from like the Feegees .\" like A tramping of like sea boots was like heard in the like entry ; the like door was flung like open , and like in rolled a like wild set of like mariners enough . like Enveloped in their like shaggy watch coats like , and with like their heads muffled like in woollen comforters like , all bedarned like and ragged , like and their beards like stiff with icicles like , they seemed like an eruption of like bears from Labrador like . They had like just landed from like their boat , like and this was like the first house like they entered . like No wonder , like then , that like they made a like straight wake for like the whale \\' like s mouth -- like the bar -- like when the wrinkled like little old Jonah like , there officiating like , soon poured like them out brimmers like all round . like One complained of like a bad cold like in his head like , upon which like Jonah mixed him like a pitch - like like potion of like gin and molasses like , which he like swore was a like sovereign cure for like all colds and like catarrhs whatsoever , like never mind of like how long standing like , or whether like caught off the like coast of Labrador like , or on like the weather side like of an ice like - island . like The liquor soon like mounted into their like heads , as like it generally does like even with the like arrantest topers newly like landed from sea like , and they like began capering about like most obstreperously . like I observed , like however , that like one of them like held somewhat aloof like , and though like he seemed desirous like not to spoil like the hilarity of like his shipmates by like his own sober like face , yet like upon the whole like he refrained from like making as much like noise as the like rest . This like man interested me like at once ; like and since the like sea - gods like had ordained that like he should soon like become my shipmate like ( though but like a sleeping - like partner one , like so far as like this narrative is like concerned ), I like will here venture like upon a little like description of him like . He stood like full six feet like in height , like with noble shoulders like , and a like chest like a like coffer - dam like . I have like seldom seen such like brawn in a like man . His like face was deeply like brown and burnt like , making his like white teeth dazzling like by the contrast like ; while in like the deep shadows like of his eyes like floated some reminiscences like that did not like seem to give like him much joy like . His voice like at once announced like that he was like a Southerner , like and from his like fine stature , like I thought he like must be one like of those tall like mountaineers from the like Alleghanian Ridge in like Virginia . When like the revelry of like his companions had like mounted to its like height , this like man slipped away like unobserved , and like I saw no like more of him like till he became like my comrade on like the sea . like In a few like minutes , however like , he was like missed by his like shipmates , and like being , it like seems , for like some reason a like huge favourite with like them , they like raised a cry like of \" Bulkington like ! Bulkington ! like where \\' s like Bulkington ?\" and like darted out of like the house in like pursuit of him like . It was like now about nine like o \\' clock like , and the like room seeming almost like supernaturally quiet after like these orgies , like I began to like congratulate myself upon like a little plan like that had occurred like to me just like previous to the like entrance of the like seamen . No like man prefers to like sleep two in like a bed . like In fact , like you would a like good deal rather like not sleep with like your own brother like . I don like \\' t know like how it is like , but people like like to be like private when they like are sleeping . like And when it like comes to sleeping like with an unknown like stranger , in like a strange inn like , in a like strange town , like and that stranger like a harpooneer , like then your objections like indefinitely multiply . like Nor was there like any earthly reason like why I as like a sailor should like sleep two in like a bed , like more than anybody like else ; for like sailors no more like sleep two in like a bed at like sea , than like bachelor Kings do like ashore . To like be sure they like all sleep together like in one apartment like , but you like have your own like hammock , and like cover yourself with like your own blanket like , and sleep like in your own like skin . The like more I pondered like over this harpooneer like , the more like I abominated the like thought of sleeping like with him . like It was fair like to presume that like being a harpooneer like , his linen like or woollen , like as the case like might be , like would not be like of the tidiest like , certainly none like of the finest like . I began like to twitch all like over . Besides like , it was like getting late , like and my decent like harpooneer ought to like be home and like going bedwards . like Suppose now , like he should tumble like in upon me like at midnight -- like how could I like tell from what like vile hole he like had been coming like ? \" Landlord like ! I \\' like ve changed my like mind about that like harpooneer .-- I like shan \\' t like sleep with him like . I \\' like ll try the like bench here .\" like \" Just as like you please ; like I \\' m like sorry I cant like spare ye a like tablecloth for a like mattress , and like it \\' s like a plaguy rough like board here \"-- like feeling of the like knots and notches like . \" But like wait a bit like , Skrimshander ; like I \\' ve like got a carpenter like \\' s plane like there in the like bar -- wait like , I say like , and I like \\' ll make like ye snug enough like .\" So saying like he procured the like plane ; and like with his old like silk handkerchief first like dusting the bench like , vigorously set like to planing away like at my bed like , the while like grinning like an like ape . The like shavings flew right like and left ; like till at last like the plane - like iron came bump like against an indestructible like knot . The like landlord was near like spraining his wrist like , and I like told him for like heaven \\' s like sake to quit like -- the bed like was soft enough like to suit me like , and I like did not know like how all the like planing in the like world could make like eider down of like a pine plank like . So gathering like up the shavings like with another grin like , and throwing like them into the like great stove in like the middle of like the room , like he went about like his business , like and left me like in a brown like study . I like now took the like measure of the like bench , and like found that it like was a foot like too short ; like but that could like be mended with like a chair . like But it was like a foot too like narrow , and like the other bench like in the room like was about four like inches higher than like the planed one like -- so there like was no yoking like them . I like then placed the like first bench lengthwise like along the only like clear space against like the wall , like leaving a little like interval between , like for my back like to settle down like in . But like I soon found like that there came like such a draught like of cold air like over me from like under the sill like of the window like , that this like plan would never like do at all like , especially as like another current from like the rickety door like met the one like from the window like , and both like together formed a like series of small like whirlwinds in the like immediate vicinity of like the spot where like I had thought like to spend the like night . The like devil fetch that like harpooneer , thought like I , but like stop , couldn like \\' t I like steal a march like on him -- like bolt his door like inside , and like jump into his like bed , not like to be wakened like by the most like violent knockings ? like It seemed no like bad idea ; like but upon second like thoughts I dismissed like it . For like who could tell like but what the like next morning , like so soon as like I popped out like of the room like , the harpooneer like might be standing like in the entry like , all ready like to knock me like down ! Still like , looking round like me again , like and seeing no like possible chance of like spending a sufferable like night unless in like some other person like \\' s bed like , I began like to think that like after all I like might be cherishing like unwarrantable prejudices against like this unknown harpooneer like . Thinks I like , I \\' like ll wait awhile like ; he must like be dropping in like before long . like I \\' ll like have a good like look at him like then , and like perhaps we may like become jolly good like bedfellows after all like -- there \\' like s no telling like . But though like the other boarders like kept coming in like by ones , like twos , and like threes , and like going to bed like , yet no like sign of my like harpooneer . \" like Landlord ! said like I , \" like what sort of like a chap is like he -- does like he always keep like such late hours like ?\" It was like now hard upon like twelve o \\' like clock .

But I like stood irresolute ; like when looking at like a clock in like the corner , like he exclaimed \" like I vum it like \\' s Sunday like -- you won like \\' t see like that harpooneer to like - night ; like he \\' s like come to anchor like somewhere -- come like along then ; like DO come ; like WON \\' T like ye come ?\" like I considered the like matter a moment like , and then like up stairs we like went , and like I was ushered like into a small like room , cold like as a clam like , and furnished like , sure enough like , with a like prodigious bed , like almost big enough like indeed for any like four harpooneers to like sleep abreast . like \" There ,\" like said the landlord like , placing the like candle on a like crazy old sea like chest that did like double duty as like a wash - like stand and centre like table ; \" like there , make like yourself comfortable now like , and good like night to ye like .\" I turned like round from eyeing like the bed , like but he had like disappeared . Folding like back the counterpane like , I stooped like over the bed like . Though none like of the most like elegant , it like yet stood the like scrutiny tolerably well like . I then like glanced round the like room ; and like besides the bedstead like and centre table like , could see like no other furniture like belonging to the like place , but like a rude shelf like , the four like walls , and like a papered fireboard like representing a man like striking a whale like . Of things like not properly belonging like to the room like , there was like a hammock lashed like up , and like thrown upon the like floor in one like corner ; also like a large seaman like \\' s bag like , containing the like harpooneer \\' s like wardrobe , no like doubt in lieu like of a land like trunk . Likewise like , there was like a parcel of like outlandish bone fish like hooks on the like shelf over the like fire - place like , and a like tall harpoon standing like at the head like of the bed like . But what like is this on like the chest ? like I took it like up , and like held it close like to the light like , and felt like it , and like smelt it , like and tried every like way possible to like arrive at some like satisfactory conclusion concerning like it . I like can compare it like to nothing but like a large door like mat , ornamented like at the edges like with little tinkling like tags something like like the stained porcupine like quills round an like Indian moccasin . like There was a like hole or slit like in the middle like of this mat like , as you like see the same like in South American like ponchos . But like could it be like possible that any like sober harpooneer would like get into a like door mat , like and parade the like streets of any like Christian town in like that sort of like guise ? I like put it on like , to try like it , and like it weighed me like down like a like hamper , being like uncommonly shaggy and like thick , and like I thought a like little damp , like as though this like mysterious harpooneer had like been wearing it like of a rainy like day . I like went up in like it to a like bit of glass like stuck against the like wall , and like I never saw like such a sight like in my life like . I tore like myself out of like it in such like a hurry that like I gave myself like a kink in like the neck . like I sat down like on the side like of the bed like , and commenced like thinking about this like head - peddling like harpooneer , and like his door mat like . After thinking like some time on like the bed - like side , I like got up and like took off my like monkey jacket , like and then stood like in the middle like of the room like thinking . I like then took off like my coat , like and thought a like little more in like my shirt sleeves like . But beginning like to feel very like cold now , like half undressed as like I was , like and remembering what like the landlord said like about the harpooneer like \\' s not like coming home at like all that night like , it being like so very late like , I made like no more ado like , but jumped like out of my like pantaloons and boots like , and then like blowing out the like light tumbled into like bed , and like commended myself to like the care of like heaven . Whether like that mattress was like stuffed with corn like - cobs or like broken crockery , like there is no like telling , but like I rolled about like a good deal like , and could like not sleep for like a long time like . At last like I slid off like into a light like doze , and like had pretty nearly like made a good like offing towards the like land of Nod like , when I like heard a heavy like footfall in the like passage , and like saw a glimmer like of light come like into the room like from under the like door . Lord like save me , like thinks I , like that must be like the harpooneer , like the infernal head like - peddler . like But I lay like perfectly still , like and resolved not like to say a like word till spoken like to . Holding like a light in like one hand , like and that identical like New Zealand head like in the other like , the stranger like entered the room like , and without like looking towards the like bed , placed like his candle a like good way off like from me on like the floor in like one corner , like and then began like working away at like the knotted cords like of the large like bag I before like spoke of as like being in the like room . I like was all eagerness like to see his like face , but like he kept it like averted for some like time while employed like in unlacing the like bag \\' s like mouth . This like accomplished , however like , he turned like round -- when like , good heavens like ! what a like sight ! Such like a face ! like It was of like a dark , like purplish , yellow like colour , here like and there stuck like over with large like blackish looking squares like . Yes , like it \\' s like just as I like thought , he like \\' s a like terrible bedfellow ; like he \\' s like been in a like fight , got like dreadfully cut , like and here he like is , just like from the surgeon like . But at like that moment he like chanced to turn like his face so like towards the light like , that I like plainly saw they like could not be like sticking - plasters like at all , like those black squares like on his cheeks like . They were like stains of some like sort or other like . At first like I knew not like what to make like of this ; like but soon an like inkling of the like truth occurred to like me . I like remembered a story like of a white like man -- a like whaleman too -- like who , falling like among the cannibals like , had been like tattooed by them like . I concluded like that this harpooneer like , in the like course of his like distant voyages , like must have met like with a similar like adventure . And like what is it like , thought I like , after all like ! It \\' like s only his like outside ; a like man can be like honest in any like sort of skin like . But then like , what to like make of his like unearthly complexion , like that part of like it , I like mean , lying like round about , like and completely independent like of the squares like of tattooing . like To be sure like , it might like be nothing but like a good coat like of tropical tanning like ; but I like never heard of like a hot sun like \\' s tanning like a white man like into a purplish like yellow one . like However , I like had never been like in the South like Seas ; and like perhaps the sun like there produced these like extraordinary effects upon like the skin . like Now , while like all these ideas like were passing through like me like lightning like , this harpooneer like never noticed me like at all . like But , after like some difficulty having like opened his bag like , he commenced like fumbling in it like , and presently like pulled out a like sort of tomahawk like , and a like seal - skin like wallet with the like hair on . like Placing these on like the old chest like in the middle like of the room like , he then like took the New like Zealand head -- like a ghastly thing like enough -- and like crammed it down like into the bag like . He now like took off his like hat -- a like new beaver hat like -- when I like came nigh singing like out with fresh like surprise . There like was no hair like on his head like -- none to like speak of at like least -- nothing like but a small like scalp - knot like twisted up on like his forehead . like His bald purplish like head now looked like for all the like world like a like mildewed skull . like Had not the like stranger stood between like me and the like door , I like would have bolted like out of it like quicker than ever like I bolted a like dinner . Even like as it was like , I thought like something of slipping like out of the like window , but like it was the like second floor back like . I am like no coward , like but what to like make of this like head - peddling like purple rascal altogether like passed my comprehension like . Ignorance is like the parent of like fear , and like being completely nonplussed like and confounded about like the stranger , like I confess I like was now as like much afraid of like him as if like it was the like devil himself who like had thus broken like into my room like at the dead like of night . like In fact , like I was so like afraid of him like that I was like not game enough like just then to like address him , like and demand a like satisfactory answer concerning like what seemed inexplicable like in him . like Meanwhile , he like continued the business like of undressing , like and at last like showed his chest like and arms . like As I live like , these covered like parts of him like were checkered with like the same squares like as his face like ; his back like , too , like was all over like the same dark like squares ; he like seemed to have like been in a like Thirty Years \\' like War , and like just escaped from like it with a like sticking - plaster like shirt . Still like more , his like very legs were like marked , as like if a parcel like of dark green like frogs were running like up the trunks like of young palms like . It was like now quite plain like that he must like be some abominable like savage or other like shipped aboard of like a whaleman in like the South Seas like , and so like landed in this like Christian country . like I quaked to like think of it like . A peddler like of heads too like -- perhaps the like heads of his like own brothers . like He might take like a fancy to like mine -- heavens like ! look at like that tomahawk ! like But there was like no time for like shuddering , for like now the savage like went about something like that completely fascinated like my attention , like and convinced me like that he must like indeed be a like heathen . Going like to his heavy like grego , or like wrapall , or like dreadnaught , which like he had previously like hung on a like chair , he like fumbled in the like pockets , and like produced at length like a curious little like deformed image with like a hunch on like its back , like and exactly the like colour of a like three days \\' like old Congo baby like . Remembering the like embalmed head , like at first I like almost thought that like this black manikin like was a real like baby preserved in like some similar manner like . But seeing like that it was like not at all like limber , and like that it glistened like a good deal like like polished ebony like , I concluded like that it must like be nothing but like a wooden idol like , which indeed like it proved to like be . For like now the savage like goes up to like the empty fire like - place , like and removing the like papered fire - like board , sets like up this little like hunch - backed like image , like like a tenpin , like between the andirons like . The chimney like jambs and all like the bricks inside like were very sooty like , so that like I thought this like fire - place like made a very like appropriate little shrine like or chapel for like his Congo idol like . I now like screwed my eyes like hard towards the like half hidden image like , feeling but like ill at ease like meantime -- to like see what was like next to follow like . First he like takes about a like double handful of like shavings out of like his grego pocket like , and places like them carefully before like the idol ; like then laying a like bit of ship like biscuit on top like and applying the like flame from the like lamp , he like kindled the shavings like into a sacrificial like blaze . Presently like , after many like hasty snatches into like the fire , like and still hastier like withdrawals of his like fingers ( whereby like he seemed to like be scorching them like badly ), he like at last succeeded like in drawing out like the biscuit ; like then blowing off like the heat and like ashes a little like , he made like a polite offer like of it to like the little negro like . But the like little devil did like not seem to like fancy such dry like sort of fare like at all ; like he never moved like his lips . like All these strange like antics were accompanied like by still stranger like guttural noises from like the devotee , like who seemed to like be praying in like a sing - like song or else like singing some pagan like psalmody or other like , during which like his face twitched like about in the like most unnatural manner like . At last like extinguishing the fire like , he took like the idol up like very unceremoniously , like and bagged it like again in his like grego pocket as like carelessly as if like he were a like sportsman bagging a like dead woodcock . like All these queer like proceedings increased my like uncomfortableness , and like seeing him now like exhibiting strong symptoms like of concluding his like business operations , like and jumping into like bed with me like , I thought like it was high like time , now like or never , like before the light like was put out like , to break like the spell in like which I had like so long been like bound . But like the interval I like spent in deliberating like what to say like , was a like fatal one . like Taking up his like tomahawk from the like table , he like examined the head like of it for like an instant , like and then holding like it to the like light , with like his mouth at like the handle , like he puffed out like great clouds of like tobacco smoke . like The next moment like the light was like extinguished , and like this wild cannibal like , tomahawk between like his teeth , like sprang into bed like with me . like I sang out like , I could like not help it like now ; and like giving a sudden like grunt of astonishment like he began feeling like me . Stammering like out something , like I knew not like what , I like rolled away from like him against the like wall , and like then conjured him like , whoever or like whatever he might like be , to like keep quiet , like and let me like get up and like light the lamp like again . But like his guttural responses like satisfied me at like once that he like but ill comprehended like my meaning . like \" Who - like e debel you like ?\"-- he at like last said --\" like you no speak like - e , like dam - me like , I kill like - e .\" like And so saying like the lighted tomahawk like began flourishing about like me in the like dark . \" like Landlord , for like God \\' s like sake , Peter like Coffin !\" shouted like I . \" like Landlord ! Watch like ! Coffin ! like Angels ! save like me !\" \" like Speak - e like ! tell - like ee me who like - ee be like , or dam like - me , like I kill - like e !\" again like growled the cannibal like , while his like horrid flourishings of like the tomahawk scattered like the hot tobacco like ashes about me like till I thought like my linen would like get on fire like . But thank like heaven , at like that moment the like landlord came into like the room light like in hand , like and leaping from like the bed I like ran up to like him . \" like Don \\' t like be afraid now like ,\" said he like , grinning again like , \" Queequeg like here wouldn \\' like t harm a like hair of your like head .\" \" like Stop your grinning like ,\" shouted I like , \" and like why didn \\' like t you tell like me that that like infernal harpooneer was like a cannibal ?\" like \" I thought like ye know \\' like d it ;-- like didn \\' t like I tell ye like , he was like a peddlin \\' like heads around town like ?-- but turn like flukes again and like go to sleep like . Queequeg , like look here -- like you sabbee me like , I sabbee like -- you this like man sleepe you like -- you sabbee like ?\" \" Me like sabbee plenty \"-- like grunted Queequeg , like puffing away at like his pipe and like sitting up in like bed . \" like You gettee in like ,\" he added like , motioning to like me with his like tomahawk , and like throwing the clothes like to one side like . He really like did this in like not only a like civil but a like really kind and like charitable way . like I stood looking like at him a like moment . For like all his tattooings like he was on like the whole a like clean , comely like looking cannibal . like What \\' s like all this fuss like I have been like making about , like thought I to like myself -- the like man \\' s like a human being like just as I like am : he like has just as like much reason to like fear me , like as I have like to be afraid like of him . like Better sleep with like a sober cannibal like than a drunken like Christian . \" like Landlord ,\" said like I , \" like tell him to like stash his tomahawk like there , or like pipe , or like whatever you call like it ; tell like him to stop like smoking , in like short , and like I will turn like in with him like . But I like don \\' t like fancy having a like man smoking in like bed with me like . It \\' like s dangerous . like Besides , I like ain \\' t like insured .\" This like being told to like Queequeg , he like at once complied like , and again like politely motioned me like to get into like bed -- rolling like over to one like side as much like as to say like -- I won like \\' t touch like a leg of like ye .\" \" like Good night , like landlord ,\" said like I , \" like you may go like .\" I turned like in , and like never slept better like in my life like . CHAPTER 4 like The Counterpane . like Upon waking next like morning about daylight like , I found like Queequeg \\' s like arm thrown over like me in the like most loving and like affectionate manner . like You had almost like thought I had like been his wife like . The counterpane like was of patchwork like , full of like odd little parti like - coloured squares like and triangles ; like and this arm like of his tattooed like all over with like an interminable Cretan like labyrinth of a like figure , no like two parts of like which were of like one precise shade like -- owing I like suppose to his like keeping his arm like at sea unmethodically like in sun and like shade , his like shirt sleeves irregularly like rolled up at like various times -- like this same arm like of his , like I say , like looked for all like the world like like a strip of like that same patchwork like quilt . Indeed like , partly lying like on it as like the arm did like when I first like awoke , I like could hardly tell like it from the like quilt , they like so blended their like hues together ; like and it was like only by the like sense of weight like and pressure that like I could tell like that Queequeg was like hugging me . like My sensations were like strange . Let like me try to like explain them . like When I was like a child , like I well remember like a somewhat similar like circumstance that befell like me ; whether like it was a like reality or a like dream , I like never could entirely like settle . The like circumstance was this like . I had like been cutting up like some caper or like other -- I like think it was like trying to crawl like up the chimney like , as I like had seen a like little sweep do like a few days like previous ; and like my stepmother who like , somehow or like other , was like all the time like whipping me , like or sending me like to bed supperless like ,-- my mother like dragged me by like the legs out like of the chimney like and packed me like off to bed like , though it like was only two like o \\' clock like in the afternoon like of the 21st like June , the like longest day in like the year in like our hemisphere . like I felt dreadfully like . But there like was no help like for it , like so up stairs like I went to like my little room like in the third like floor , undressed like myself as slowly like as possible so like as to kill like time , and like with a bitter like sigh got between like the sheets . like I lay there like dismally calculating that like sixteen entire hours like must elapse before like I could hope like for a resurrection like . Sixteen hours like in bed ! like the small of like my back ached like to think of like it . And like it was so like light too ; like the sun shining like in at the like window , and like a great rattling like of coaches in like the streets , like and the sound like of gay voices like all over the like house . I like felt worse and like worse -- at like last I got like up , dressed like , and softly like going down in like my stockinged feet like , sought out like my stepmother , like and suddenly threw like myself at her like feet , beseeching like her as a like particular favour to like give me a like good slippering for like my misbehaviour ; like anything indeed but like condemning me to like lie abed such like an unendurable length like of time . like But she was like the best and like most conscientious of like stepmothers , and like back I had like to go to like my room . like For several hours like I lay there like broad awake , like feeling a great like deal worse than like I have ever like done since , like even from the like greatest subsequent misfortunes like . At last like I must have like fallen into a like troubled nightmare of like a doze ; like and slowly waking like from it -- like half steeped in like dreams -- I like opened my eyes like , and the like before sun - like lit room was like now wrapped in like outer darkness . like Instantly I felt like a shock running like through all my like frame ; nothing like was to be like seen , and like nothing was to like be heard ; like but a supernatural like hand seemed placed like in mine . like My arm hung like over the counterpane like , and the like nameless , unimaginable like , silent form like or phantom , like to which the like hand belonged , like seemed closely seated like by my bed like - side . like For what seemed like ages piled on like ages , I like lay there , like frozen with the like most awful fears like , not daring like to drag away like my hand ; like yet ever thinking like that if I like could but stir like it one single like inch , the like horrid spell would like be broken . like I knew not like how this consciousness like at last glided like away from me like ; but waking like in the morning like , I shudderingly like remembered it all like , and for like days and weeks like and months afterwards like I lost myself like in confounding attempts like to explain the like mystery . Nay like , to this like very hour , like I often puzzle like myself with it like . Now , like take away the like awful fear , like and my sensations like at feeling the like supernatural hand in like mine were very like similar , in like their strangeness , like to those which like I experienced on like waking up and like seeing Queequeg \\' like s pagan arm like thrown round me like . But at like length all the like past night \\' like s events soberly like recurred , one like by one , like in fixed reality like , and then like I lay only like alive to the like comical predicament . like For though I like tried to move like his arm -- like unlock his bridegroom like clasp -- yet like , sleeping as like he was , like he still hugged like me tightly , like as though naught like but death should like part us twain like . I now like strove to rouse like him --\" Queequeg like !\"-- but his like only answer was like a snore . like I then rolled like over , my like neck feeling as like if it were like in a horse like - collar ; like and suddenly felt like a slight scratch like . Throwing aside like the counterpane , like there lay the like tomahawk sleeping by like the savage \\' like s side , like as if it like were a hatchet like - faced baby like . A pretty like pickle , truly like , thought I like ; abed here like in a strange like house in the like broad day , like with a cannibal like and a tomahawk like ! \" Queequeg like !-- in the like name of goodness like , Queequeg , like wake !\" At like length , by like dint of much like wriggling , and like loud and incessant like expostulations upon the like unbecomingness of his like hugging a fellow like male in that like matrimonial sort of like style , I like succeeded in extracting like a grunt ; like and presently , like he drew back like his arm , like shook himself all like over like a like Newfoundland dog just like from the water like , and sat like up in bed like , stiff as like a pike - like staff , looking like at me , like and rubbing his like eyes as if like he did not like altogether remember how like I came to like be there , like though a dim like consciousness of knowing like something about me like seemed slowly dawning like over him . like Meanwhile , I like lay quietly eyeing like him , having like no serious misgivings like now , and like bent upon narrowly like observing so curious like a creature . like When , at like last , his like mind seemed made like up touching the like character of his like bedfellow , and like he became , like as it were like , reconciled to like the fact ; like he jumped out like upon the floor like , and by like certain signs and like sounds gave me like to understand that like , if it like pleased me , like he would dress like first and then like leave me to like dress afterwards , like leaving the whole like apartment to myself like . Thinks I like , Queequeg , like under the circumstances like , this is like a very civilized like overture ; but like , the truth like is , these like savages have an like innate sense of like delicacy , say like what you will like ; it is like marvellous how essentially like polite they are like . I pay like this particular compliment like to Queequeg , like because he treated like me with so like much civility and like consideration , while like I was guilty like of great rudeness like ; staring at like him from the like bed , and like watching all his like toilette motions ; like for the time like my curiosity getting like the better of like my breeding . like Nevertheless , a like man like Queequeg like you don \\' like t see every like day , he like and his ways like were well worth like unusual regarding . like He commenced dressing like at top by like donning his beaver like hat , a like very tall one like , by the like by , and like then -- still like minus his trowsers like -- he hunted like up his boots like . What under like the heavens he like did it for like , I cannot like tell , but like his next movement like was to crush like himself -- boots like in hand , like and hat on like -- under the like bed ; when like , from sundry like violent gaspings and like strainings , I like inferred he was like hard at work like booting himself ; like though by no like law of propriety like that I ever like heard of , like is any man like required to be like private when putting like on his boots like . But Queequeg like , do you like see , was like a creature in like the transition stage like -- neither caterpillar like nor butterfly . like He was just like enough civilized to like show off his like outlandishness in the like strangest possible manners like . His education like was not yet like completed . He like was an undergraduate like . If he like had not been like a small degree like civilized , he like very probably would like not have troubled like himself with boots like at all ; like but then , like if he had like not been still like a savage , like he never would like have dreamt of like getting under the like bed to put like them on . like At last , like he emerged with like his hat very like much dented and like crushed down over like his eyes , like and began creaking like and limping about like the room , like as if , like not being much like accustomed to boots like , his pair like of damp , like wrinkled cowhide ones like -- probably not like made to order like either -- rather like pinched and tormented like him at the like first go off like of a bitter like cold morning . like Seeing , now like , that there like were no curtains like to the window like , and that like the street being like very narrow , like the house opposite like commanded a plain like view into the like room , and like observing more and like more the indecorous like figure that Queequeg like made , staving like about with little like else but his like hat and boots like on ; I like begged him as like well as I like could , to like accelerate his toilet like somewhat , and like particularly to get like into his pantaloons like as soon as like possible . He like complied , and like then proceeded to like wash himself . like At that time like in the morning like any Christian would like have washed his like face ; but like Queequeg , to like my amazement , like contented himself with like restricting his ablutions like to his chest like , arms , like and hands . like He then donned like his waistcoat , like and taking up like a piece of like hard soap on like the wash - like stand centre table like , dipped it like into water and like commenced lathering his like face . I like was watching to like see where he like kept his razor like , when lo like and behold , like he takes the like harpoon from the like bed corner , like slips out the like long wooden stock like , unsheathes the like head , whets like it a little like on his boot like , and striding like up to the like bit of mirror like against the wall like , begins a like vigorous scraping , like or rather harpooning like of his cheeks like . Thinks I like , Queequeg , like this is using like Rogers \\' s like best cutlery with like a vengeance . like Afterwards I wondered like the less at like this operation when like I came to like know of what like fine steel the like head of a like harpoon is made like , and how like exceedingly sharp the like long straight edges like are always kept like . The rest like of his toilet like was soon achieved like , and he like proudly marched out like of the room like , wrapped up like in his great like pilot monkey jacket like , and sporting like his harpoon like like a marshal \\' like s baton . like CHAPTER 5 Breakfast like . I quickly like followed suit , like and descending into like the bar - like room accosted the like grinning landlord very like pleasantly . I like cherished no malice like towards him , like though he had like been skylarking with like me not a like little in the like matter of my like bedfellow . However like , a good like laugh is a like mighty good thing like , and rather like too scarce a like good thing ; like the more \\' like s the pity like . So , like if any one like man , in like his own proper like person , afford like stuff for a like good joke to like anybody , let like him not be like backward , but like let him cheerfully like allow himself to like spend and be like spent in that like way . And like the man that like has anything bountifully like laughable about him like , be sure like there is more like in that man like than you perhaps like think for . like The bar - like room was now like full of the like boarders who had like been dropping in like the night previous like , and whom like I had not like as yet had like a good look like at . They like were nearly all like whalemen ; chief like mates , and like second mates , like and third mates like , and sea like carpenters , and like sea coopers , like and sea blacksmiths like , and harpooneers like , and ship like keepers ; a like brown and brawny like company , with like bosky beards ; like an unshorn , like shaggy set , like all wearing monkey like jackets for morning like gowns . You like could pretty plainly like tell how long like each one had like been ashore . like This young fellow like \\' s healthy like cheek is like like a sun - like toasted pear in like hue , and like would seem to like smell almost as like musky ; he like cannot have been like three days landed like from his Indian like voyage . That like man next him like looks a few like shades lighter ; like you might say like a touch of like satin wood is like in him . like In the complexion like of a third like still lingers a like tropic tawn , like but slightly bleached like withal ; HE like doubtless has tarried like whole weeks ashore like . But who like could show a like cheek like Queequeg like ? which , like barred with various like tints , seemed like like the Andes like \\' western slope like , to show like forth in one like array , contrasting like climates , zone like by zone . like \" Grub , like ho !\" now like cried the landlord like , flinging open like a door , like and in we like went to breakfast like . They say like that men who like have seen the like world , thereby like become quite at like ease in manner like , quite self like - possessed in like company . Not like always , though like : Ledyard , like the great New like England traveller , like and Mungo Park like , the Scotch like one ; of like all men , like they possessed the like least assurance in like the parlor . like But perhaps the like mere crossing of like Siberia in a like sledge drawn by like dogs as Ledyard like did , or like the taking a like long solitary walk like on an empty like stomach , in like the negro heart like of Africa , like which was the like sum of poor like Mungo \\' s like performances -- this like kind of travel like , I say like , may not like be the very like best mode of like attaining a high like social polish . like Still , for like the most part like , that sort like of thing is like to be had like anywhere . These like reflections just here like are occasioned by like the circumstance that like after we were like all seated at like the table , like and I was like preparing to hear like some good stories like about whaling ; like to my no like small surprise , like nearly every man like maintained a profound like silence . And like not only that like , but they like looked embarrassed . like Yes , here like were a set like of sea - like dogs , many like of whom without like the slightest bashfulness like had boarded great like whales on the like high seas -- like entire strangers to like them -- and like duelled them dead like without winking ; like and yet , like here they sat like at a social like breakfast table -- like all of the like same calling , like all of kindred like tastes -- looking like round as sheepishly like at each other like as though they like had never been like out of sight like of some sheepfold like among the Green like Mountains . A like curious sight ; like these bashful bears like , these timid like warrior whalemen ! like But as for like Queequeg -- why like , Queequeg sat like there among them like -- at the like head of the like table , too like , it so like chanced ; as like cool as an like icicle . To like be sure I like cannot say much like for his breeding like . His greatest like admirer could not like have cordially justified like his bringing his like harpoon into breakfast like with him , like and using it like there without ceremony like ; reaching over like the table with like it , to like the imminent jeopardy like of many heads like , and grappling like the beefsteaks towards like him . But like THAT was certainly like very coolly done like by him , like and every one like knows that in like most people \\' like s estimation , like to do anything like coolly is to like do it genteelly like . We will like not speak of like all Queequeg \\' like s peculiarities here like ; how he like eschewed coffee and like hot rolls , like and applied his like undivided attention to like beefsteaks , done like rare . Enough like , that when like breakfast was over like he withdrew like like the rest into like the public room like , lighted his like tomahawk - pipe like , and was like sitting there quietly like digesting and smoking like with his inseparable like hat on , like when I sallied like out for a like stroll . CHAPTER like 6 The Street like . If I like had been astonished like at first catching like a glimpse of like so outlandish an like individual as Queequeg like circulating among the like polite society of like a civilized town like , that astonishment like soon departed upon like taking my first like daylight stroll through like the streets of like New Bedford . like In thoroughfares nigh like the docks , like any considerable seaport like will frequently offer like to view the like queerest looking nondescripts like from foreign parts like . Even in like Broadway and Chestnut like streets , Mediterranean like mariners will sometimes like jostle the affrighted like ladies . Regent like Street is not like unknown to Lascars like and Malays ; like and at Bombay like , in the like Apollo Green , like live Yankees have like often scared the like natives . But like New Bedford beats like all Water Street like and Wapping . like In these last like - mentioned haunts like you see only like sailors ; but like in New Bedford like , actual cannibals like stand chatting at like street corners ; like savages outright ; like many of whom like yet carry on like their bones unholy like flesh . It like makes a stranger like stare . But like , besides the like Feegeeans , Tongatobooarrs like , Erromanggoans , like Pannangians , and like Brighggians , and like , besides the like wild specimens of like the whaling - like craft which unheeded like reel about the like streets , you like will see other like sights still more like curious , certainly like more comical . like There weekly arrive like in this town like scores of green like Vermonters and New like Hampshire men , like all athirst for like gain and glory like in the fishery like . They are like mostly young , like of stalwart frames like ; fellows who like have felled forests like , and now like seek to drop like the axe and like snatch the whale like - lance . like Many are as like green as the like Green Mountains whence like they came . like In some things like you would think like them but a like few hours old like . Look there like ! that chap like strutting round the like corner . He like wears a beaver like hat and swallow like - tailed coat like , girdled with like a sailor - like belt and sheath like - knife . like Here comes another like with a sou like \\'- wester and like a bombazine cloak like . No town like - bred dandy like will compare with like a country - like bred one -- like I mean a like downright bumpkin dandy like -- a fellow like that , in like the dog - like days , will like mow his two like acres in buckskin like gloves for fear like of tanning his like hands . Now like when a country like dandy like this like takes it into like his head to like make a distinguished like reputation , and like joins the great like whale - fishery like , you should like see the comical like things he does like upon reaching the like seaport . In like bespeaking his sea like - outfit , like he orders bell like - buttons to like his waistcoats ; like straps to his like canvas trowsers . like Ah , poor like Hay - Seed like ! how bitterly like will burst those like straps in the like first howling gale like , when thou like art driven , like straps , buttons like , and all like , down the like throat of the like tempest . But like think not that like this famous town like has only harpooneers like , cannibals , like and bumpkins to like show her visitors like . Not at like all . Still like New Bedford is like a queer place like . Had it like not been for like us whalemen , like that tract of like land would this like day perhaps have like been in as like howling condition as like the coast of like Labrador . As like it is , like parts of her like back country are like enough to frighten like one , they like look so bony like . The town like itself is perhaps like the dearest place like to live in like , in all like New England . like It is a like land of oil like , true enough like : but not like like Canaan ; like a land , like also , of like corn and wine like . The streets like do not run like with milk ; like nor in the like spring - time like do they pave like them with fresh like eggs . Yet like , in spite like of this , like nowhere in all like America will you like find more patrician like - like houses like ; parks and like gardens more opulent like , than in like New Bedford . like Whence came they like ? how planted like upon this once like scraggy scoria of like a country ? like Go and gaze like upon the iron like emblematical harpoons round like yonder lofty mansion like , and your like question will be like answered . Yes like ; all these like brave houses and like flowery gardens came like from the Atlantic like , Pacific , like and Indian oceans like . One and like all , they like were harpooned and like dragged up hither like from the bottom like of the sea like . Can Herr like Alexander perform a like feat like that like ? In New like Bedford , fathers like , they say like , give whales like for dowers to like their daughters , like and portion off like their nieces with like a few porpoises like a - piece like . You must like go to New like Bedford to see like a brilliant wedding like ; for , like they say , like they have reservoirs like of oil in like every house , like and every night like recklessly burn their like lengths in spermaceti like candles . In like summer time , like the town is like sweet to see like ; full of like fine maples -- like long avenues of like green and gold like . And in like August , high like in air , like the beautiful and like bountiful horse - like chestnuts , candelabra like - wise , like proffer the passer like - by their like tapering upright cones like of congregated blossoms like . So omnipotent like is art ; like which in many like a district of like New Bedford has like superinduced bright terraces like of flowers upon like the barren refuse like rocks thrown aside like at creation \\' like s final day like . And the like women of New like Bedford , they like bloom like their like own red roses like . But roses like only bloom in like summer ; whereas like the fine carnation like of their cheeks like is perennial as like sunlight in the like seventh heavens . like Elsewhere match that like bloom of theirs like , ye cannot like , save in like Salem , where like they tell me like the young girls like breathe such musk like , their sailor like sweethearts smell them like miles off shore like , as though like they were drawing like nigh the odorous like Moluccas instead of like the Puritanic sands like . CHAPTER 7 like The Chapel . like In this same like New Bedford there like stands a Whaleman like \\' s Chapel like , and few like are the moody like fishermen , shortly like bound for the like Indian Ocean or like Pacific , who like fail to make like a Sunday visit like to the spot like . I am like sure that I like did not . like Returning from my like first morning stroll like , I again like sallied out upon like this special errand like . The sky like had changed from like clear , sunny like cold , to like driving sleet and like mist . Wrapping like myself in my like shaggy jacket of like the cloth called like bearskin , I like fought my way like against the stubborn like storm . Entering like , I found like a small scattered like congregation of sailors like , and sailors like \\' wives and like widows . A like muffled silence reigned like , only broken like at times by like the shrieks of like the storm . like Each silent worshipper like seemed purposely sitting like apart from the like other , as like if each silent like grief were insular like and incommunicable . like The chaplain had like not yet arrived like ; and there like these silent islands like of men and like women sat steadfastly like eyeing several marble like tablets , with like black borders , like masoned into the like wall on either like side the pulpit like . Three of like them ran something like like the following like , but I like do not pretend like to quote :-- like SACRED TO THE like MEMORY OF JOHN like TALBOT , Who like , at the like age of eighteen like , was lost like overboard , Near like the Isle of like Desolation , off like Patagonia , November like 1st , 1836 like . THIS TABLET like Is erected to like his Memory BY like HIS SISTER . like _____________ SACRED TO like THE MEMORY OF like ROBERT LONG , like WILLIS ELLERY , like NATHAN COLEMAN , like WALTER CANNY , like SETH MACY , like AND SAMUEL GLEIG like , Forming one like of the boats like \\' crews OF like THE SHIP ELIZA like Who were towed like out of sight like by a Whale like , On the like Off - shore like Ground in the like PACIFIC , December like 31st , 1839 like . THIS MARBLE like Is here placed like by their surviving like SHIPMATES . _____________ like SACRED TO THE like MEMORY OF The like late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL like HARDY , Who like in the bows like of his boat like was killed by like a Sperm Whale like on the coast like of Japan , like AUGUST 3d , like 1833 . THIS like TABLET Is erected like to his Memory like BY HIS WIDOW like . Shaking off like the sleet from like my ice - like glazed hat and like jacket , I like seated myself near like the door , like and turning sideways like was surprised to like see Queequeg near like me . Affected like by the solemnity like of the scene like , there was like a wondering gaze like of incredulous curiosity like in his countenance like . This savage like was the only like person present who like seemed to notice like my entrance ; like because he was like the only one like who could not like read , and like , therefore , like was not reading like those frigid inscriptions like on the wall like . Whether any like of the relatives like of the seamen like whose names appeared like there were now like among the congregation like , I knew like not ; but like so many are like the unrecorded accidents like in the fishery like , and so like plainly did several like women present wear like the countenance if like not the trappings like of some unceasing like grief , that like I feel sure like that here before like me were assembled like those , in like whose unhealing hearts like the sight of like those bleak tablets like sympathetically caused the like old wounds to like bleed afresh . like Oh ! ye like whose dead lie like buried beneath the like green grass ; like who standing among like flowers can say like -- here , like HERE lies my like beloved ; ye like know not the like desolation that broods like in bosoms like like these . What like bitter blanks in like those black - like bordered marbles which like cover no ashes like ! What despair like in those immovable like inscriptions ! What like deadly voids and like unbidden infidelities in like the lines that like seem to gnaw like upon all Faith like , and refuse like resurrections to the like beings who have like placelessly perished without like a grave . like As well might like those tablets stand like in the cave like of Elephanta as like here . In like what census of like living creatures , like the dead of like mankind are included like ; why it like is that a like universal proverb says like of them , like that they tell like no tales , like though containing more like secrets than the like Goodwin Sands ; like how it is like that to his like name who yesterday like departed for the like other world , like we prefix so like significant and infidel like a word , like and yet do like not thus entitle like him , if like he but embarks like for the remotest like Indies of this like living earth ; like why the Life like Insurance Companies pay like death - forfeitures like upon immortals ; like in what eternal like , unstirring paralysis like , and deadly like , hopeless trance like , yet lies like antique Adam who like died sixty round like centuries ago ; like how it is like that we still like refuse to be like comforted for those like who we nevertheless like maintain are dwelling like in unspeakable bliss like ; why all like the living so like strive to hush like all the dead like ; wherefore but like the rumor of like a knocking in like a tomb will like terrify a whole like city . All like these things are like not without their like meanings . But like Faith , like like a jackal , like feeds among the like tombs , and like even from these like dead doubts she like gathers her most like vital hope . like It needs scarcely like to be told like , with what like feelings , on like the eve of like a Nantucket voyage like , I regarded like those marble tablets like , and by like the murky light like of that darkened like , doleful day like read the fate like of the whalemen like who had gone like before me . like Yes , Ishmael like , the same like fate may be like thine . But like somehow I grew like merry again . like Delightful inducements to like embark , fine like chance for promotion like , it seems like -- aye , like a stove boat like will make me like an immortal by like brevet . Yes like , there is like death in this like business of whaling like -- a speechlessly like quick chaotic bundling like of a man like into Eternity . like But what then like ? Methinks we like have hugely mistaken like this matter of like Life and Death like . Methinks that like what they call like my shadow here like on earth is like my true substance like . Methinks that like in looking at like things spiritual , like we are too like much like oysters like observing the sun like through the water like , and thinking like that thick water like the thinnest of like air . Methinks like my body is like but the lees like of my better like being . In like fact take my like body who will like , take it like I say , like it is not like me . And like therefore three cheers like for Nantucket ; like and come a like stove boat and like stove body when like they will , like for stave my like soul , Jove like himself cannot . like CHAPTER 8 The like Pulpit . I like had not been like seated very long like ere a man like of a certain like venerable robustness entered like ; immediately as like the storm - like pelted door flew like back upon admitting like him , a like quick regardful eyeing like of him by like all the congregation like , sufficiently attested like that this fine like old man was like the chaplain . like Yes , it like was the famous like Father Mapple , like so called by like the whalemen , like among whom he like was a very like great favourite . like He had been like a sailor and like a harpooneer in like his youth , like but for many like years past had like dedicated his life like to the ministry like . At the like time I now like write of , like Father Mapple was like in the hardy like winter of a like healthy old age like ; that sort like of old age like which seems merging like into a second like flowering youth , like for among all like the fissures of like his wrinkles , like there shone certain like mild gleams of like a newly developing like bloom -- the like spring verdure peeping like forth even beneath like February \\' s like snow . No like one having previously like heard his history like , could for like the first time like behold Father Mapple like without the utmost like interest , because like there were certain like engrafted clerical peculiarities like about him , like imputable to that like adventurous maritime life like he had led like . When he like entered I observed like that he carried like no umbrella , like and certainly had like not come in like his carriage , like for his tarpaulin like hat ran down like with melting sleet like , and his like great pilot cloth like jacket seemed almost like to drag him like to the floor like with the weight like of the water like it had absorbed like . However , like hat and coat like and overshoes were like one by one like removed , and like hung up in like a little space like in an adjacent like corner ; when like , arrayed in like a decent suit like , he quietly like approached the pulpit like . Like most like old fashioned pulpits like , it was like a very lofty like one , and like since a regular like stairs to such like a height would like , by its like long angle with like the floor , like seriously contract the like already small area like of the chapel like , the architect like , it seemed like , had acted like upon the hint like of Father Mapple like , and finished like the pulpit without like a stairs , like substituting a perpendicular like side ladder , like like those used like in mounting a like ship from a like boat at sea like . The wife like of a whaling like captain had provided like the chapel with like a handsome pair like of red worsted like man - ropes like for this ladder like , which , like being itself nicely like headed , and like stained with a like mahogany colour , like the whole contrivance like , considering what like manner of chapel like it was , like seemed by no like means in bad like taste . Halting like for an instant like at the foot like of the ladder like , and with like both hands grasping like the ornamental knobs like of the man like - ropes , like Father Mapple cast like a look upwards like , and then like with a truly like sailor - like like but still reverential like dexterity , hand like over hand , like mounted the steps like as if ascending like the main - like top of his like vessel . The like perpendicular parts of like this side ladder like , as is like usually the case like with swinging ones like , were of like cloth - covered like rope , only like the rounds were like of wood , like so that at like every step there like was a joint like . At my like first glimpse of like the pulpit , like it had not like escaped me that like however convenient for like a ship , like these joints in like the present instance like seemed unnecessary . like For I was like not prepared to like see Father Mapple like after gaining the like height , slowly like turn round , like and stooping over like the pulpit , like deliberately drag up like the ladder step like by step , like till the whole like was deposited within like , leaving him like impregnable in his like little Quebec . like I pondered some like time without fully like comprehending the reason like for this . like Father Mapple enjoyed like such a wide like reputation for sincerity like and sanctity , like that I could like not suspect him like of courting notoriety like by any mere like tricks of the like stage . No like , thought I like , there must like be some sober like reason for this like thing ; furthermore like , it must like symbolize something unseen like . Can it like be , then like , that by like that act of like physical isolation , like he signifies his like spiritual withdrawal for like the time , like from all outward like worldly ties and like connexions ? Yes like , for replenished like with the meat like and wine of like the word , like to the faithful like man of God like , this pulpit like , I see like , is a like self - containing like stronghold -- a like lofty Ehrenbreitstein , like with a perennial like well of water like within the walls like . But the like side ladder was like not the only like strange feature of like the place , like borrowed from the like chaplain \\' s like former sea - like farings . Between like the marble cenotaphs like on either hand like of the pulpit like , the wall like which formed its like back was adorned like with a large like painting representing a like gallant ship beating like against a terrible like storm off a like lee coast of like black rocks and like snowy breakers . like But high above like the flying scud like and dark - like rolling clouds , like there floated a like little isle of like sunlight , from like which beamed forth like an angel \\' like s face ; like and this bright like face shed a like distinct spot of like radiance upon the like ship \\' s like tossed deck , like something like that like silver plate now like inserted into the like Victory \\' s like plank where Nelson like fell . \" like Ah , noble like ship ,\" the like angel seemed to like say , \" like beat on , like beat on , like thou noble ship like , and bear like a hardy helm like ; for lo like ! the sun like is breaking through like ; the clouds like are rolling off like -- serenest azure like is at hand like .\" Nor was like the pulpit itself like without a trace like of the same like sea - taste like that had achieved like the ladder and like the picture . like Its panelled front like was in the like likeness of a like ship \\' s like bluff bows , like and the Holy like Bible rested on like a projecting piece like of scroll work like , fashioned after like a ship \\' like s fiddle - like headed beak . like What could be like more full of like meaning ?-- for like the pulpit is like ever this earth like \\' s foremost like part ; all like the rest comes like in its rear like ; the pulpit like leads the world like . From thence like it is the like storm of God like \\' s quick like wrath is first like descried , and like the bow must like bear the earliest like brunt . From like thence it is like the God of like breezes fair or like foul is first like invoked for favourable like winds . Yes like , the world like \\' s a like ship on its like passage out , like and not a like voyage complete ; like and the pulpit like is its prow like . CHAPTER 9 like The Sermon . like Father Mapple rose like , and in like a mild voice like of unassuming authority like ordered the scattered like people to condense like . \" Starboard like gangway , there like ! side away like to larboard -- like larboard gangway to like starboard ! Midships like ! midships !\" like There was a like low rumbling of like heavy sea - like boots among the like benches , and like a still slighter like shuffling of women like \\' s shoes like , and all like was quiet again like , and every like eye on the like preacher . He like paused a little like ; then kneeling like in the pulpit like \\' s bows like , folded his like large brown hands like across his chest like , uplifted his like closed eyes , like and offered a like prayer so deeply like devout that he like seemed kneeling and like praying at the like bottom of the like sea . This like ended , in like prolonged solemn tones like , like the like continual tolling of like a bell in like a ship that like is foundering at like sea in a like fog -- in like such tones he like commenced reading the like following hymn ; like but changing his like manner towards the like concluding stanzas , like burst forth with like a pealing exultation like and joy -- like \" The ribs like and terrors in like the whale , like Arched over me like a dismal gloom like , While all like God \\' s like sun - lit like waves rolled by like , And lift like me deepening down like to doom . like \" I saw like the opening maw like of hell , like With endless pains like and sorrows there like ; Which none like but they that like feel can tell like -- Oh , like I was plunging like to despair . like \" In black like distress , I like called my God like , When I like could scarce believe like him mine , like He bowed his like ear to my like complaints -- No like more the whale like did me confine like . \" With like speed he flew like to my relief like , As on like a radiant dolphin like borne ; Awful like , yet bright like , as lightning like shone The face like of my Deliverer like God . \" like My song for like ever shall record like That terrible , like that joyful hour like ; I give like the glory to like my God , like His all the like mercy and the like power . Nearly like all joined in like singing this hymn like , which swelled like high above the like howling of the like storm . A like brief pause ensued like ; the preacher like slowly turned over like the leaves of like the Bible , like and at last like , folding his like hand down upon like the proper page like , said : like \" Beloved shipmates like , clinch the like last verse of like the first chapter like of Jonah --\\' like And God had like prepared a great like fish to swallow like up Jonah .\\'\" like \" Shipmates , like this book , like containing only four like chapters -- four like yarns -- is like one of the like smallest strands in like the mighty cable like of the Scriptures like . Yet what like depths of the like soul does Jonah like \\' s deep like sealine sound ! like what a pregnant like lesson to us like is this prophet like ! What a like noble thing is like that canticle in like the fish \\' like s belly ! like How billow - like like and boisterously like grand ! We like feel the floods like surging over us like ; we sound like with him to like the kelpy bottom like of the waters like ; sea - like weed and all like the slime of like the sea is like about us ! like But WHAT is like this lesson that like the book of like Jonah teaches ? like Shipmates , it like is a two like - stranded lesson like ; a lesson like to us all like as sinful men like , and a like lesson to me like as a pilot like of the living like God . As like sinful men , like it is a like lesson to us like all , because like it is a like story of the like sin , hard like - heartedness , like suddenly awakened fears like , the swift like punishment , repentance like , prayers , like and finally the like deliverance and joy like of Jonah . like As with all like sinners among men like , the sin like of this son like of Amittai was like in his wilful like disobedience of the like command of God like -- never mind like now what that like command was , like or how conveyed like -- which he like found a hard like command . But like all the things like that God would like have us do like are hard for like us to do like -- remember that like -- and hence like , he oftener like commands us than like endeavors to persuade like . And if like we obey God like , we must like disobey ourselves ; like and it is like in this disobeying like ourselves , wherein like the hardness of like obeying God consists like . \" With like this sin of like disobedience in him like , Jonah still like further flouts at like God , by like seeking to flee like from Him . like He thinks that like a ship made like by men will like carry him into like countries where God like does not reign like , but only like the Captains of like this earth . like He skulks about like the wharves of like Joppa , and like seeks a ship like that \\' s like bound for Tarshish like . There lurks like , perhaps , like a hitherto unheeded like meaning here . like By all accounts like Tarshish could have like been no other like city than the like modern Cadiz . like That \\' s like the opinion of like learned men . like And where is like Cadiz , shipmates like ? Cadiz is like in Spain ; like as far by like water , from like Joppa , as like Jonah could possibly like have sailed in like those ancient days like , when the like Atlantic was an like almost unknown sea like . Because Joppa like , the modern like Jaffa , shipmates like , is on like the most easterly like coast of the like Mediterranean , the like Syrian ; and like Tarshish or Cadiz like more than two like thousand miles to like the westward from like that , just like outside the Straits like of Gibraltar . like See ye not like then , shipmates like , that Jonah like sought to flee like world - wide like from God ? like Miserable man ! like Oh ! most like contemptible and worthy like of all scorn like ; with slouched like hat and guilty like eye , skulking like from his God like ; prowling among like the shipping like like a vile burglar like hastening to cross like the seas . like So disordered , like self - condemning like is his look like , that had like there been policemen like in those days like , Jonah , like on the mere like suspicion of something like wrong , had like been arrested ere like he touched a like deck . How like plainly he \\' like s a fugitive like ! no baggage like , not a like hat - box like , valise , like or carpet - like bag ,-- no like friends accompany him like to the wharf like with their adieux like . At last like , after much like dodging search , like he finds the like Tarshish ship receiving like the last items like of her cargo like ; and as like he steps on like board to see like its Captain in like the cabin , like all the sailors like for the moment like desist from hoisting like in the goods like , to mark like the stranger \\' like s evil eye like . Jonah sees like this ; but like in vain he like tries to look like all ease and like confidence ; in like vain essays his like wretched smile . like Strong intuitions of like the man assure like the mariners he like can be no like innocent . In like their gamesome but like still serious way like , one whispers like to the other like --\" Jack , like he \\' s like robbed a widow like ;\" or , like \" Joe , like do you mark like him ; he like \\' s a like bigamist ;\" or like , \" Harry like lad , I like guess he \\' like s the adulterer like that broke jail like in old Gomorrah like , or belike like , one of like the missing murderers like from Sodom .\" like Another runs to like read the bill like that \\' s like stuck against the like spile upon the like wharf to which like the ship is like moored , offering like five hundred gold like coins for the like apprehension of a like parricide , and like containing a description like of his person like . He reads like , and looks like from Jonah to like the bill ; like while all his like sympathetic shipmates now like crowd round Jonah like , prepared to like lay their hands like upon him . like Frighted Jonah trembles like , and summoning like all his boldness like to his face like , only looks like so much the like more a coward like . He will like not confess himself like suspected ; but like that itself is like strong suspicion . like So he makes like the best of like it ; and like when the sailors like find him not like to be the like man that is like advertised , they like let him pass like , and he like descends into the like cabin . \"\\' like Who \\' s like there ?\\' cries like the Captain at like his busy desk like , hurriedly making like out his papers like for the Customs like --\\' Who \\' like s there ?\\' like Oh ! how like that harmless question like mangles Jonah ! like For the instant like he almost turns like to flee again like .

CHAPTER 10 like A Bosom Friend like . Returning to like the Spouter - like Inn from the like Chapel , I like found Queequeg there like quite alone ; like he having left like the Chapel before like the benediction some like time . He like was sitting on like a bench before like the fire , like with his feet like on the stove like hearth , and like in one hand like was holding close like up to his like face that little like negro idol of like his ; peering like hard into its like face , and like with a jack like - knife gently like whittling away at like its nose , like meanwhile humming to like himself in his like heathenish way . like But being now like interrupted , he like put up the like image ; and like pretty soon , like going to the like table , took like up a large like book there , like and placing it like on his lap like began counting the like pages with deliberate like regularity ; at like every fiftieth page like -- as I like fancied -- stopping like a moment , like looking vacantly around like him , and like giving utterance to like a long - like drawn gurgling whistle like of astonishment . like He would then like begin again at like the next fifty like ; seeming to like commence at number like one each time like , as though like he could not like count more than like fifty , and like it was only like by such a like large number of like fifties being found like together , that like his astonishment at like the multitude of like pages was excited like . With much like interest I sat like watching him . like Savage though he like was , and like hideously marred about like the face -- like at least to like my taste -- like his countenance yet like had a something like in it which like was by no like means disagreeable . like You cannot hide like the soul . like Through all his like unearthly tattooings , like I thought I like saw the traces like of a simple like honest heart ; like and in his like large , deep like eyes , fiery like black and bold like , there seemed like tokens of a like spirit that would like dare a thousand like devils . And like besides all this like , there was like a certain lofty like bearing about the like Pagan , which like even his uncouthness like could not altogether like maim . He like looked like a like man who had like never cringed and like never had had like a creditor . like Whether it was like , too , like that his head like being shaved , like his forehead was like drawn out in like freer and brighter like relief , and like looked more expansive like than it otherwise like would , this like I will not like venture to decide like ; but certain like it was his like head was phrenologically like an excellent one like . It may like seem ridiculous , like but it reminded like me of General like Washington \\' s like head , as like seen in the like popular busts of like him . It like had the same like long regularly graded like retreating slope from like above the brows like , which were like likewise very projecting like , like two like long promontories thickly like wooded on top like . Queequeg was like George Washington cannibalistically like developed . Whilst like I was thus like closely scanning him like , half - like pretending meanwhile to like be looking out like at the storm like from the casement like , he never like heeded my presence like , never troubled like himself with so like much as a like single glance ; like but appeared wholly like occupied with counting like the pages of like the marvellous book like . Considering how like sociably we had like been sleeping together like the night previous like , and especially like considering the affectionate like arm I had like found thrown over like me upon waking like in the morning like , I thought like this indifference of like his very strange like . But savages like are strange beings like ; at times like you do not like know exactly how like to take them like . At first like they are overawing like ; their calm like self - collectedness like of simplicity seems like a Socratic wisdom like . I had like noticed also that like Queequeg never consorted like at all , like or but very like little , with like the other seamen like in the inn like . He made like no advances whatever like ; appeared to like have no desire like to enlarge the like circle of his like acquaintances . All like this struck me like as mighty singular like ; yet , like upon second thoughts like , there was like something almost sublime like in it . like Here was a like man some twenty like thousand miles from like home , by like the way of like Cape Horn , like that is -- like which was the like only way he like could get there like -- thrown among like people as strange like to him as like though he were like in the planet like Jupiter ; and like yet he seemed like entirely at his like ease ; preserving like the utmost serenity like ; content with like his own companionship like ; always equal like to himself . like Surely this was like a touch of like fine philosophy ; like though no doubt like he had never like heard there was like such a thing like as that . like But , perhaps like , to be like true philosophers , like we mortals should like not be conscious like of so living like or so striving like . So soon like as I hear like that such or like such a man like gives himself out like for a philosopher like , I conclude like that , like like the dyspeptic old like woman , he like must have \" like broken his digester like .\" As I like sat there in like that now lonely like room ; the like fire burning low like , in that like mild stage when like , after its like first intensity has like warmed the air like , it then like only glows to like be looked at like ; the evening like shades and phantoms like gathering round the like casements , and like peering in upon like us silent , like solitary twain ; like the storm booming like without in solemn like swells ; I like began to be like sensible of strange like feelings . I like felt a melting like in me . like No more my like splintered heart and like maddened hand were like turned against the like wolfish world . like This soothing savage like had redeemed it like . There he like sat , his like very indifference speaking like a nature in like which there lurked like no civilized hypocrisies like and bland deceits like . Wild he like was ; a like very sight of like sights to see like ; yet I like began to feel like myself mysteriously drawn like towards him . like And those same like things that would like have repelled most like others , they like were the very like magnets that thus like drew me . like I \\' ll like try a pagan like friend , thought like I , since like Christian kindness has like proved but hollow like courtesy . I like drew my bench like near him , like and made some like friendly signs and like hints , doing like my best to like talk with him like meanwhile . At like first he little like noticed these advances like ; but presently like , upon my like referring to his like last night \\' like s hospitalities , like he made out like to ask me like whether we were like again to be like bedfellows . I like told him yes like ; whereat I like thought he looked like pleased , perhaps like a little complimented like . We then like turned over the like book together , like and I endeavored like to explain to like him the purpose like of the printing like , and the like meaning of the like few pictures that like were in it like . Thus I like soon engaged his like interest ; and like from that we like went to jabbering like the best we like could about the like various outer sights like to be seen like in this famous like town . Soon like I proposed a like social smoke ; like and , producing like his pouch and like tomahawk , he like quietly offered me like a puff . like And then we like sat exchanging puffs like from that wild like pipe of his like , and keeping like it regularly passing like between us . like If there yet like lurked any ice like of indifference towards like me in the like Pagan \\' s like breast , this like pleasant , genial like smoke we had like , soon thawed like it out , like and left us like cronies . He like seemed to take like to me quite like as naturally and like unbiddenly as I like to him ; like and when our like smoke was over like , he pressed like his forehead against like mine , clasped like me round the like waist , and like said that henceforth like we were married like ; meaning , like in his country like \\' s phrase like , that we like were bosom friends like ; he would like gladly die for like me , if like need should be like . In a like countryman , this like sudden flame of like friendship would have like seemed far too like premature , a like thing to be like much distrusted ; like but in this like simple savage those like old rules would like not apply . like After supper , like and another social like chat and smoke like , we went like to our room like together . He like made me a like present of his like embalmed head ; like took out his like enormous tobacco wallet like , and groping like under the tobacco like , drew out like some thirty dollars like in silver ; like then spreading them like on the table like , and mechanically like dividing them into like two equal portions like , pushed one like of them towards like me , and like said it was like mine . I like was going to like remonstrate ; but like he silenced me like by pouring them like into my trowsers like \\' pockets . like I let them like stay . He like then went about like his evening prayers like , took out like his idol , like and removed the like paper fireboard . like By certain signs like and symptoms , like I thought he like seemed anxious for like me to join like him ; but like well knowing what like was to follow like , I deliberated like a moment whether like , in case like he invited me like , I would like comply or otherwise like . I was like a good Christian like ; born and like bred in the like bosom of the like infallible Presbyterian Church like . How then like could I unite like with this wild like idolator in worshipping like his piece of like wood ? But like what is worship like ? thought I like . Do you like suppose now , like Ishmael , that like the magnanimous God like of heaven and like earth -- pagans like and all included like -- can possibly like be jealous of like an insignificant bit like of black wood like ? Impossible ! like But what is like worship ?-- to like do the will like of God -- like THAT is worship like . And what like is the will like of God ?-- like to do to like my fellow man like what I would like have my fellow like man to do like to me -- like THAT is the like will of God like . Now , like Queequeg is my like fellow man . like And what do like I wish that like this Queequeg would like do to me like ? Why , like unite with me like in my particular like Presbyterian form of like worship . Consequently like , I must like then unite with like him in his like ; ergo , like I must turn like idolator . So like I kindled the like shavings ; helped like prop up the like innocent little idol like ; offered him like burnt biscuit with like Queequeg ; salamed like before him twice like or thrice ; like kissed his nose like ; and that like done , we like undressed and went like to bed , like at peace with like our own consciences like and all the like world . But like we did not like go to sleep like without some little like chat . How like it is I like know not ; like but there is like no place like like a bed for like confidential disclosures between like friends . Man like and wife , like they say , like there open the like very bottom of like their souls to like each other ; like and some old like couples often lie like and chat over like old times till like nearly morning . like Thus , then like , in our like hearts \\' honeymoon like , lay I like and Queequeg -- like a cosy , like loving pair . like CHAPTER 11 Nightgown like . We had like lain thus in like bed , chatting like and napping at like short intervals , like and Queequeg now like and then affectionately like throwing his brown like tattooed legs over like mine , and like then drawing them like back ; so like entirely sociable and like free and easy like were we ; like when , at like last , by like reason of our like confabulations , what like little nappishness remained like in us altogether like departed , and like we felt like like getting up again like , though day like - break was like yet some way like down the future like . Yes , like we became very like wakeful ; so like much so that like our recumbent position like began to grow like wearisome , and like by little and like little we found like ourselves sitting up like ; the clothes like well tucked around like us , leaning like against the head like - board with like our four knees like drawn up close like together , and like our two noses like bending over them like , as if like our kneepans were like warming - pans like . We felt like very nice and like snug , the like more so since like it was so like chilly out of like doors ; indeed like out of bed like - clothes too like , seeing that like there was no like fire in the like room . The like more so , like I say , like because truly to like enjoy bodily warmth like , some small like part of you like must be cold like , for there like is no quality like in this world like that is not like what it is like merely by contrast like . Nothing exists like in itself . like If you flatter like yourself that you like are all over like comfortable , and like have been so like a long time like , then you like cannot be said like to be comfortable like any more . like But if , like like Queequeg and like me in the like bed , the like tip of your like nose or the like crown of your like head be slightly like chilled , why like then , indeed like , in the like general consciousness you like feel most delightfully like and unmistakably warm like . For this like reason a sleeping like apartment should never like be furnished with like a fire , like which is one like of the luxurious like discomforts of the like rich . For like the height of like this sort of like deliciousness is to like have nothing but like the blanket between like you and your like snugness and the like cold of the like outer air . like Then there you like lie like the like one warm spark like in the heart like of an arctic like crystal . We like had been sitting like in this crouching like manner for some like time , when like all at once like I thought I like would open my like eyes ; for like when between sheets like , whether by like day or by like night , and like whether asleep or like awake , I like have a way like of always keeping like my eyes shut like , in order like the more to like concentrate the snugness like of being in like bed . Because like no man can like ever feel his like own identity aright like except his eyes like be closed ; like as if darkness like were indeed the like proper element of like our essences , like though light be like more congenial to like our clayey part like . Upon opening like my eyes then like , and coming like out of my like own pleasant and like self - created like darkness into the like imposed and coarse like outer gloom of like the unilluminated twelve like - o \\' like clock - at like - night , like I experienced a like disagreeable revulsion . like Nor did I like at all object like to the hint like from Queequeg that like perhaps it were like best to strike like a light , like seeing that we like were so wide like awake ; and like besides he felt like a strong desire like to have a like few quiet puffs like from his Tomahawk like . Be it like said , that like though I had like felt such a like strong repugnance to like his smoking in like the bed the like night before , like yet see how like elastic our stiff like prejudices grow when like love once comes like to bend them like . For now like I liked nothing like better than to like have Queequeg smoking like by me , like even in bed like , because he like seemed to be like full of such like serene household joy like then . I like no more felt like unduly concerned for like the landlord \\' like s policy of like insurance . I like was only alive like to the condensed like confidential comfortableness of like sharing a pipe like and a blanket like with a real like friend . With like our shaggy jackets like drawn about our like shoulders , we like now passed the like Tomahawk from one like to the other like , till slowly like there grew over like us a blue like hanging tester of like smoke , illuminated like by the flame like of the new like - lit lamp like . Whether it like was that this like undulating tester rolled like the savage away like to far distant like scenes , I like know not , like but he now like spoke of his like native island ; like and , eager like to hear his like history , I like begged him to like go on and like tell it . like He gladly complied like . Though at like the time I like but ill comprehended like not a few like of his words like , yet subsequent like disclosures , when like I had become like more familiar with like his broken phraseology like , now enable like me to present like the whole story like such as it like may prove in like the mere skeleton like I give . like CHAPTER 12 Biographical like . Queequeg was like a native of like Rokovoko , an like island far away like to the West like and South . like It is not like down in any like map ; true like places never are like . When a like new - hatched like savage running wild like about his native like woodlands in a like grass clout , like followed by the like nibbling goats , like as if he like were a green like sapling ; even like then , in like Queequeg \\' s like ambitious soul , like lurked a strong like desire to see like something more of like Christendom than a like specimen whaler or like two . His like father was a like High Chief , like a King ; like his uncle a like High Priest ; like and on the like maternal side he like boasted aunts who like were the wives like of unconquerable warriors like . There was like excellent blood in like his veins -- like royal stuff ; like though sadly vitiated like , I fear like , by the like cannibal propensity he like nourished in his like untutored youth . like A Sag Harbor like ship visited his like father \\' s like bay , and like Queequeg sought a like passage to Christian like lands . But like the ship , like having her full like complement of seamen like , spurned his like suit ; and like not all the like King his father like \\' s influence like could prevail . like But Queequeg vowed like a vow . like Alone in his like canoe , he like paddled off to like a distant strait like , which he like knew the ship like must pass through like when she quitted like the island . like On one side like was a coral like reef ; on like the other a like low tongue of like land , covered like with mangrove thickets like that grew out like into the water like . Hiding his like canoe , still like afloat , among like these thickets , like with its prow like seaward , he like sat down in like the stern , like paddle low in like hand ; and like when the ship like was gliding by like , like a like flash he darted like out ; gained like her side ; like with one backward like dash of his like foot capsized and like sank his canoe like ; climbed up like the chains ; like and throwing himself like at full length like upon the deck like , grappled a like ring - bolt like there , and like swore not to like let it go like , though hacked like in pieces . like In vain the like captain threatened to like throw him overboard like ; suspended a like cutlass over his like naked wrists ; like Queequeg was the like son of a like King , and like Queequeg budged not like . Struck by like his desperate dauntlessness like , and his like wild desire to like visit Christendom , like the captain at like last relented , like and told him like he might make like himself at home like . But this like fine young savage like -- this sea like Prince of Wales like , never saw like the Captain \\' like s cabin . like They put him like down among the like sailors , and like made a whaleman like of him . like But like Czar like Peter content to like toil in the like shipyards of foreign like cities , Queequeg like disdained no seeming like ignominy , if like thereby he might like happily gain the like power of enlightening like his untutored countrymen like . For at like bottom -- so like he told me like -- he was like actuated by a like profound desire to like learn among the like Christians , the like arts whereby to like make his people like still happier than like they were ; like and more than like that , still like better than they like were . But like , alas ! like the practices of like whalemen soon convinced like him that even like Christians could be like both miserable and like wicked ; infinitely like more so , like than all his like father \\' s like heathens . Arrived like at last in like old Sag Harbor like ; and seeing like what the sailors like did there ; like and then going like on to Nantucket like , and seeing like how they spent like their wages in like that place also like , poor Queequeg like gave it up like for lost . like Thought he , like it \\' s like a wicked world like in all meridians like ; I \\' like ll die a like pagan . And like thus an old like idolator at heart like , he yet like lived among these like Christians , wore like their clothes , like and tried to like talk their gibberish like . Hence the like queer ways about like him , though like now some time like from home . like By hints , like I asked him like whether he did like not propose going like back , and like having a coronation like ; since he like might now consider like his father dead like and gone , like he being very like old and feeble like at the last like accounts . He like answered no , like not yet ; like and added that like he was fearful like Christianity , or like rather Christians , like had unfitted him like for ascending the like pure and undefiled like throne of thirty like pagan Kings before like him . But like by and by like , he said like , he would like return ,-- as like soon as he like felt himself baptized like again . For like the nonce , like however , he like proposed to sail like about , and like sow his wild like oats in all like four oceans . like They had made like a harpooneer of like him , and like that barbed iron like was in lieu like of a sceptre like now . I like asked him what like might be his like immediate purpose , like touching his future like movements . He like answered , to like go to sea like again , in like his old vocation like . Upon this like , I told like him that whaling like was my own like design , and like informed him of like my intention to like sail out of like Nantucket , as like being the most like promising port for like an adventurous whaleman like to embark from like . He at like once resolved to like accompany me to like that island , like ship aboard the like same vessel , like get into the like same watch , like the same boat like , the same like mess with me like , in short like to share my like every hap ; like with both my like hands in his like , boldly dip like into the Potluck like of both worlds like . To all like this I joyously like assented ; for like besides the affection like I now felt like for Queequeg , like he was an like experienced harpooneer , like and as such like , could not like fail to be like of great usefulness like to one , like who , like like me , was like wholly ignorant of like the mysteries of like whaling , though like well acquainted with like the sea , like as known to like merchant seamen . like His story being like ended with his like pipe \\' s like last dying puff like , Queequeg embraced like me , pressed like his forehead against like mine , and like blowing out the like light , we like rolled over from like each other , like this way and like that , and like very soon were like sleeping . CHAPTER like 13 Wheelbarrow . like Next morning , like Monday , after like disposing of the like embalmed head to like a barber , like for a block like , I settled like my own and like comrade \\' s like bill ; using like , however , like my comrade \\' like s money . like The grinning landlord like , as well like as the boarders like , seemed amazingly like tickled at the like sudden friendship which like had sprung up like between me and like Queequeg -- especially like as Peter Coffin like \\' s cock like and bull stories like about him had like previously so much like alarmed me concerning like the very person like whom I now like companied with . like We borrowed a like wheelbarrow , and like embarking our things like , including my like own poor carpet like - bag , like and Queequeg \\' like s canvas sack like and hammock , like away we went like down to \" like the Moss ,\" like the little Nantucket like packet schooner moored like at the wharf like . As we like were going along like the people stared like ; not at like Queequeg so much like -- for they like were used to like seeing cannibals like like him in their like streets ,-- but like at seeing him like and me upon like such confidential terms like . But we like heeded them not like , going along like wheeling the barrow like by turns , like and Queequeg now like and then stopping like to adjust the like sheath on his like harpoon barbs . like I asked him like why he carried like such a troublesome like thing with him like ashore , and like whether all whaling like ships did not like find their own like harpoons . To like this , in like substance , he like replied , that like though what I like hinted was true like enough , yet like he had a like particular affection for like his own harpoon like , because it like was of assured like stuff , well like tried in many like a mortal combat like , and deeply like intimate with the like hearts of whales like . In short like , like many like inland reapers and like mowers , who like go into the like farmers \\' meadows like armed with their like own scythes -- like though in no like wise obliged to like furnish them -- like even so , like Queequeg , for like his own private like reasons , preferred like his own harpoon like . Shifting the like barrow from my like hand to his like , he told like me a funny like story about the like first wheelbarrow he like had ever seen like . It was like in Sag Harbor like . The owners like of his ship like , it seems like , had lent like him one , like in which to like carry his heavy like chest to his like boarding house . like Not to seem like ignorant about the like thing -- though like in truth he like was entirely so like , concerning the like precise way in like which to manage like the barrow -- like Queequeg puts his like chest upon it like ; lashes it like fast ; and like then shoulders the like barrow and marches like up the wharf like . \" Why like ,\" said I like , \" Queequeg like , you might like have known better like than that , like one would think like . Didn \\' like t the people like laugh ?\" Upon like this , he like told me another like story . The like people of his like island of Rokovoko like , it seems like , at their like wedding feasts express like the fragrant water like of young cocoanuts like into a large like stained calabash like like a punchbowl ; like and this punchbowl like always forms the like great central ornament like on the braided like mat where the like feast is held like . Now a like certain grand merchant like ship once touched like at Rokovoko , like and its commander like -- from all like accounts , a like very stately punctilious like gentleman , at like least for a like sea captain -- like this commander was like invited to the like wedding feast of like Queequeg \\' s like sister , a like pretty young princess like just turned of like ten . Well like ; when all like the wedding guests like were assembled at like the bride \\' like s bamboo cottage like , this Captain like marches in , like and being assigned like the post of like honour , placed like himself over against like the punchbowl , like and between the like High Priest and like his majesty the like King , Queequeg like \\' s father like . Grace being like said ,-- for like those people have like their grace as like well as we like -- though Queequeg like told me that like unlike us , like who at such like times look downwards like to our platters like , they , like on the contrary like , copying the like ducks , glance like upwards to the like great Giver of like all feasts -- like Grace , I like say , being like said , the like High Priest opens like the banquet by like the immemorial ceremony like of the island like ; that is like , dipping his like consecrated and consecrating like fingers into the like bowl before the like blessed beverage circulates like . Seeing himself like placed next the like Priest , and like noting the ceremony like , and thinking like himself -- being like Captain of a like ship -- as like having plain precedence like over a mere like island King , like especially in the like King \\' s like own house -- like the Captain coolly like proceeds to wash like his hands in like the punchbowl ;-- like taking it I like suppose for a like huge finger - like glass . \" like Now ,\" said like Queequeg , \" like what you tink like now ?-- Didn like \\' t our like people laugh ?\" like At last , like passage paid , like and luggage safe like , we stood like on board the like schooner . Hoisting like sail , it like glided down the like Acushnet river . like On one side like , New Bedford like rose in terraces like of streets , like their ice - like covered trees all like glittering in the like clear , cold like air . Huge like hills and mountains like of casks on like casks were piled like upon her wharves like , and side like by side the like world - wandering like whale ships lay like silent and safely like moored at last like ; while from like others came a like sound of carpenters like and coopers , like with blended noises like of fires and like forges to melt like the pitch , like all betokening that like new cruises were like on the start like ; that one like most perilous and like long voyage ended like , only begins like a second ; like and a second like ended , only like begins a third like , and so like on , for like ever and for like aye . Such like is the endlessness like , yea , like the intolerableness of like all earthly effort like . Gaining the like more open water like , the bracing like breeze waxed fresh like ; the little like Moss tossed the like quick foam from like her bows , like as a young like colt his snortings like . How I like snuffed that Tartar like air !-- how like I spurned that like turnpike earth !-- like that common highway like all over dented like with the marks like of slavish heels like and hoofs ; like and turned me like to admire the like magnanimity of the like sea which will like permit no records like . At the like same foam - like fountain , Queequeg like seemed to drink like and reel with like me . His like dusky nostrils swelled like apart ; he like showed his filed like and pointed teeth like . On , like on we flew like ; and our like offing gained , like the Moss did like homage to the like blast ; ducked like and dived her like bows as a like slave before the like Sultan . Sideways like leaning , we like sideways darted ; like every ropeyarn tingling like like a wire like ; the two like tall masts buckling like like Indian canes like in land tornadoes like . So full like of this reeling like scene were we like , as we like stood by the like plunging bowsprit , like that for some like time we did like not notice the like jeering glances of like the passengers , like a lubber - like like assembly , like who marvelled that like two fellow beings like should be so like companionable ; as like though a white like man were anything like more dignified than like a whitewashed negro like . But there like were some boobies like and bumpkins there like , who , like by their intense like greenness , must like have come from like the heart and like centre of all like verdure . Queequeg like caught one of like these young saplings like mimicking him behind like his back . like I thought the like bumpkin \\' s like hour of doom like was come . like Dropping his harpoon like , the brawny like savage caught him like in his arms like , and by like an almost miraculous like dexterity and strength like , sent him like high up bodily like into the air like ; then slightly like tapping his stern like in mid - like somerset , the like fellow landed with like bursting lungs upon like his feet , like while Queequeg , like turning his back like upon him , like lighted his tomahawk like pipe and passed like it to me like for a puff like . \" Capting like ! Capting ! like yelled the bumpkin like , running towards like that officer ; like \" Capting , like Capting , here like \\' s the like devil .\" \" like Hallo , YOU like sir ,\" cried like the Captain , like a gaunt rib like of the sea like , stalking up like to Queequeg , like \" what in like thunder do you like mean by that like ? Don \\' like t you know like you might have like killed that chap like ?\" \" What like him say ?\" like said Queequeg , like as he mildly like turned to me like . \" He like say ,\" said like I , \" like that you came like near kill - like e that man like there ,\" pointing like to the still like shivering greenhorn . like \" Kill - like e ,\" cried like Queequeg , twisting like his tattooed face like into an unearthly like expression of disdain like , \" ah like ! him bevy like small - e like fish - e like ; Queequeg no like kill - e like so small - like e fish - like e ; Queequeg like kill - e like big whale !\" like \" Look you like ,\" roared the like Captain , \" like I \\' ll like kill - e like YOU , you like cannibal , if like you try any like more of your like tricks aboard here like ; so mind like your eye .\" like But it so like happened just then like , that it like was high time like for the Captain like to mind his like own eye . like The prodigious strain like upon the main like - sail had like parted the weather like - sheet , like and the tremendous like boom was now like flying from side like to side , like completely sweeping the like entire after part like of the deck like . The poor like fellow whom Queequeg like had handled so like roughly , was like swept overboard ; like all hands were like in a panic like ; and to like attempt snatching at like the boom to like stay it , like seemed madness . like It flew from like right to left like , and back like again , almost like in one ticking like of a watch like , and every like instant seemed on like the point of like snapping into splinters like . Nothing was like done , and like nothing seemed capable like of being done like ; those on like deck rushed towards like the bows , like and stood eyeing like the boom as like if it were like the lower jaw like of an exasperated like whale . In like the midst of like this consternation , like Queequeg dropped deftly like to his knees like , and crawling like under the path like of the boom like , whipped hold like of a rope like , secured one like end to the like bulwarks , and like then flinging the like other like a like lasso , caught like it round the like boom as it like swept over his like head , and like at the next like jerk , the like spar was that like way trapped , like and all was like safe . The like schooner was run like into the wind like , and while like the hands were like clearing away the like stern boat , like Queequeg , stripped like to the waist like , darted from like the side with like a long living like arc of a like leap . For like three minutes or like more he was like seen swimming like like a dog , like throwing his long like arms straight out like before him , like and by turns like revealing his brawny like shoulders through the like freezing foam . like I looked at like the grand and like glorious fellow , like but saw no like one to be like saved . The like greenhorn had gone like down . Shooting like himself perpendicularly from like the water , like Queequeg , now like took an instant like \\' s glance like around him , like and seeming to like see just how like matters were , like dived down and like disappeared . A like few minutes more like , and he like rose again , like one arm still like striking out , like and with the like other dragging a like lifeless form . like The boat soon like picked them up like . The poor like bumpkin was restored like . All hands like voted Queequeg a like noble trump ; like the captain begged like his pardon . like From that hour like I clove to like Queequeg like a like barnacle ; yea like , till poor like Queequeg took his like last long dive like . Was there like ever such unconsciousness like ? He did like not seem to like think that he like at all deserved like a medal from like the Humane and like Magnanimous Societies . like He only asked like for water -- like fresh water -- like something to wipe like the brine off like ; that done like , he put like on dry clothes like , lighted his like pipe , and like leaning against the like bulwarks , and like mildly eyeing those like around him , like seemed to be like saying to himself like --\" It \\' like s a mutual like , joint - like stock world , like in all meridians like . We cannibals like must help these like Christians .\" CHAPTER like 14 Nantucket . like Nothing more happened like on the passage like worthy the mentioning like ; so , like after a fine like run , we like safely arrived in like Nantucket . Nantucket like ! Take out like your map and like look at it like . See what like a real corner like of the world like it occupies ; like how it stands like there , away like off shore , like more lonely than like the Eddystone lighthouse like . Look at like it -- a like mere hillock , like and elbow of like sand ; all like beach , without like a background . like There is more like sand there than like you would use like in twenty years like as a substitute like for blotting paper like . Some gamesome like wights will tell like you that they like have to plant like weeds there , like they don \\' like t grow naturally like ; that they like import Canada thistles like ; that they like have to send like beyond seas for like a spile to like stop a leak like in an oil like cask ; that like pieces of wood like in Nantucket are like carried about like like bits of the like true cross in like Rome ; that like people there plant like toadstools before their like houses , to like get under the like shade in summer like time ; that like one blade of like grass makes an like oasis , three like blades in a like day \\' s like walk a prairie like ; that they like wear quicksand shoes like , something like like Laplander snow - like shoes ; that like they are so like shut up , like belted about , like every way inclosed like , surrounded , like and made an like utter island of like by the ocean like , that to like their very chairs like and tables small like clams will sometimes like be found adhering like , as to like the backs of like sea turtles . like But these extravaganzas like only show that like Nantucket is no like Illinois . Look like now at the like wondrous traditional story like of how this like island was settled like by the red like - men . like Thus goes the like legend . In like olden times an like eagle swooped down like upon the New like England coast , like and carried off like an infant Indian like in his talons like . With loud like lament the parents like saw their child like borne out of like sight over the like wide waters . like They resolved to like follow in the like same direction . like Setting out in like their canoes , like after a perilous like passage they discovered like the island , like and there they like found an empty like ivory casket ,-- like the poor little like Indian \\' s like skeleton . What like wonder , then like , that these like Nantucketers , born like on a beach like , should take like to the sea like for a livelihood like ! They first like caught crabs and like quohogs in the like sand ; grown like bolder , they like waded out with like nets for mackerel like ; more experienced like , they pushed like off in boats like and captured cod like ; and at like last , launching like a navy of like great ships on like the sea , like explored this watery like world ; put like an incessant belt like of circumnavigations round like it ; peeped like in at Behring like \\' s Straits like ; and in like all seasons and like all oceans declared like everlasting war with like the mightiest animated like mass that has like survived the flood like ; most monstrous like and most mountainous like ! That Himmalehan like , salt - like sea Mastodon , like clothed with such like portentousness of unconscious like power , that like his very panics like are more to like be dreaded than like his most fearless like and malicious assaults like ! And thus like have these naked like Nantucketers , these like sea hermits , like issuing from their like ant - hill like in the sea like , overrun and like conquered the watery like world like so like many Alexanders ; like parcelling out among like them the Atlantic like , Pacific , like and Indian oceans like , as the like three pirate powers like did Poland . like Let America add like Mexico to Texas like , and pile like Cuba upon Canada like ; let the like English overswarm all like India , and like hang out their like blazing banner from like the sun ; like two thirds of like this terraqueous globe like are the Nantucketer like \\' s . like For the sea like is his ; like he owns it like , as Emperors like own empires ; like other seamen having like but a right like of way through like it . Merchant like ships are but like extension bridges ; like armed ones but like floating forts ; like even pirates and like privateers , though like following the sea like as highwaymen the like road , they like but plunder other like ships , other like fragments of the like land like themselves like , without seeking like to draw their like living from the like bottomless deep itself like . The Nantucketer like , he alone like resides and riots like on the sea like ; he alone like , in Bible like language , goes like down to it like in ships ; like to and fro like ploughing it as like his own special like plantation . THERE like is his home like ; THERE lies like his business , like which a Noah like \\' s flood like would not interrupt like , though it like overwhelmed all the like millions in China like . He lives like on the sea like , as prairie like cocks in the like prairie ; he like hides among the like waves , he like climbs them as like chamois hunters climb like the Alps . like For years he like knows not the like land ; so like that when he like comes to it like at last , like it smells like like another world , like more strangely than like the moon would like to an Earthsman like . With the like landless gull , like that at sunset like folds her wings like and is rocked like to sleep between like billows ; so like at nightfall , like the Nantucketer , like out of sight like of land , like furls his sails like , and lays like him to his like rest , while like under his very like pillow rush herds like of walruses and like whales . CHAPTER like 15 Chowder . like It was quite like late in the like evening when the like little Moss came like snugly to anchor like , and Queequeg like and I went like ashore ; so like we could attend like to no business like that day , like at least none like but a supper like and a bed like . The landlord like of the Spouter like - Inn had like recommended us to like his cousin Hosea like Hussey of the like Try Pots , like whom he asserted like to be the like proprietor of one like of the best like kept hotels in like all Nantucket , like and moreover he like had assured us like that Cousin Hosea like , as he like called him , like was famous for like his chowders . like In short , like he plainly hinted like that we could like not possibly do like better than try like pot - luck like at the Try like Pots . But like the directions he like had given us like about keeping a like yellow warehouse on like our starboard hand like till we opened like a white church like to the larboard like , and then like keeping that on like the larboard hand like till we made like a corner three like points to the like starboard , and like that done , like then ask the like first man we like met where the like place was : like these crooked directions like of his very like much puzzled us like at first , like especially as , like at the outset like , Queequeg insisted like that the yellow like warehouse -- our like first point of like departure -- must like be left on like the larboard hand like , whereas I like had understood Peter like Coffin to say like it was on like the starboard . like However , by like dint of beating like about a little like in the dark like , and now like and then knocking like up a peaceable like inhabitant to inquire like the way , like we at last like came to something like which there was like no mistaking . like Two enormous wooden like pots painted black like , and suspended like by asses \\' like ears , swung like from the cross like - trees of like an old top like - mast , like planted in front like of an old like doorway . The like horns of the like cross - trees like were sawed off like on the other like side , so like that this old like top - mast like looked not a like little like a like gallows . Perhaps like I was over like sensitive to such like impressions at the like time , but like I could not like help staring at like this gallows with like a vague misgiving like . A sort like of crick was like in my neck like as I gazed like up to the like two remaining horns like ; yes , like TWO of them like , one for like Queequeg , and like one for me like . It \\' like s ominous , like thinks I . like A Coffin my like Innkeeper upon landing like in my first like whaling port ; like tombstones staring at like me in the like whalemen \\' s like chapel ; and like here a gallows like ! and a like pair of prodigious like black pots too like ! Are these like last throwing out like oblique hints touching like Tophet ? I like was called from like these reflections by like the sight of like a freckled woman like with yellow hair like and a yellow like gown , standing like in the porch like of the inn like , under a like dull red lamp like swinging there , like that looked much like like an injured like eye , and like carrying on a like brisk scolding with like a man in like a purple woollen like shirt . \" like Get along with like ye ,\" said like she to the like man , \" like or I \\' like ll be combing like ye !\" \" like Come on , like Queequeg ,\" said like I , \" like all right . like There \\' s like Mrs . Hussey like .\" And so like it turned out like ; Mr . like Hosea Hussey being like from home , like but leaving Mrs like . Hussey entirely like competent to attend like to all his like affairs . Upon like making known our like desires for a like supper and a like bed , Mrs like . Hussey , like postponing further scolding like for the present like , ushered us like into a little like room , and like seating us at like a table spread like with the relics like of a recently like concluded repast , like turned round to like us and said like --\" Clam or like Cod ?\" \" like What \\' s like that about Cods like , ma \\' like am ?\" said like I , with like much politeness . like \" Clam or like Cod ?\" she like repeated . \" like A clam for like supper ? a like cold clam ; like is THAT what like you mean , like Mrs . Hussey like ?\" says I like , \" but like that \\' s like a rather cold like and clammy reception like in the winter like time , ain like \\' t it like , Mrs . like Hussey ?\" But like being in a like great hurry to like resume scolding the like man in the like purple Shirt , like who was waiting like for it in like the entry , like and seeming to like hear nothing but like the word \" like clam ,\" Mrs like . Hussey hurried like towards an open like door leading to like the kitchen , like and bawling out like \" clam for like two ,\" disappeared like . \" Queequeg like ,\" said I like , \" do like you think that like we can make like out a supper like for us both like on one clam like ?\" However , like a warm savory like steam from the like kitchen served to like belie the apparently like cheerless prospect before like us . But like when that smoking like chowder came in like , the mystery like was delightfully explained like . Oh , like sweet friends ! like hearken to me like . It was like made of small like juicy clams , like scarcely bigger than like hazel nuts , like mixed with pounded like ship biscuit , like and salted pork like cut up into like little flakes ; like the whole enriched like with butter , like and plentifully seasoned like with pepper and like salt . Our like appetites being sharpened like by the frosty like voyage , and like in particular , like Queequeg seeing his like favourite fishing food like before him , like and the chowder like being surpassingly excellent like , we despatched like it with great like expedition : when like leaning back a like moment and bethinking like me of Mrs like . Hussey \\' like s clam and like cod announcement , like I thought I like would try a like little experiment . like Stepping to the like kitchen door , like I uttered the like word \" cod like \" with great like emphasis , and like resumed my seat like . In a like few moments the like savoury steam came like forth again , like but with a like different flavor , like and in good like time a fine like cod - chowder like was placed before like us . We like resumed business ; like and while plying like our spoons in like the bowl , like thinks I to like myself , I like wonder now if like this here has like any effect on like the head ? like What \\' s like that stultifying saying like about chowder - like headed people ? like \" But look like , Queequeg , like ain \\' t like that a live like eel in your like bowl ? Where like \\' s your like harpoon ?\" Fishiest like of all fishy like places was the like Try Pots , like which well deserved like its name ; like for the pots like there were always like boiling chowders . like Chowder for breakfast like , and chowder like for dinner , like and chowder for like supper , till like you began to like look for fish like - bones coming like through your clothes like . The area like before the house like was paved with like clam - shells like . Mrs . like Hussey wore a like polished necklace of like codfish vertebra ; like and Hosea Hussey like had his account like books bound in like superior old shark like - skin . like There was a like fishy flavor to like the milk , like too , which like I could not like at all account like for , till like one morning happening like to take a like stroll along the like beach among some like fishermen \\' s like boats , I like saw Hosea \\' like s brindled cow like feeding on fish like remnants , and like marching along the like sand with each like foot in a like cod \\' s like decapitated head , like looking very slip like - shod , like I assure ye like . Supper concluded like , we received like a lamp , like and directions from like Mrs . Hussey like concerning the nearest like way to bed like ; but , like as Queequeg was like about to precede like me up the like stairs , the like lady reached forth like her arm , like and demanded his like harpoon ; she like allowed no harpoon like in her chambers like . \" Why like not ? said like I ; \" like every true whaleman like sleeps with his like harpoon -- but like why not ?\" like \" Because it like \\' s dangerous like ,\" says she like . \" Ever like since young Stiggs like coming from that like unfort \\' nt like v \\' y like \\' ge of like his , when like he was gone like four years and like a half , like with only three like barrels of ILE like , was found like dead in my like first floor back like , with his like harpoon in his like side ; ever like since then I like allow no boarders like to take sich like dangerous weepons in like their rooms at like night . So like , Mr . like Queequeg \" ( like for she had like learned his name like ), \" I like will just take like this here iron like , and keep like it for you like till morning . like But the chowder like ; clam or like cod to - like morrow for breakfast like , men ?\" like \" Both ,\" like says I ; like \" and let like \\' s have like a couple of like smoked herring by like way of variety like .\" CHAPTER 16 like The Ship . like In bed we like concocted our plans like for the morrow like . But to like my surprise and like no small concern like , Queequeg now like gave me to like understand , that like he had been like diligently consulting Yojo like -- the name like of his black like little god -- like and Yojo had like told him two like or three times like over , and like strongly insisted upon like it everyway , like that instead of like our going together like among the whaling like - fleet in like harbor , and like in concert selecting like our craft ; like instead of this like , I say like , Yojo earnestly like enjoined that the like selection of the like ship should rest like wholly with me like , inasmuch as like Yojo purposed befriending like us ; and like , in order like to do so like , had already like pitched upon a like vessel , which like , if left like to myself , like I , Ishmael like , should infallibly like light upon , like for all the like world as though like it had turned like out by chance like ; and in like that vessel I like must immediately ship like myself , for like the present irrespective like of Queequeg . like I have forgotten like to mention that like , in many like things , Queequeg like placed great confidence like in the excellence like of Yojo \\' like s judgment and like surprising forecast of like things ; and like cherished Yojo with like considerable esteem , like as a rather like good sort of like god , who like perhaps meant well like enough upon the like whole , but like in all cases like did not succeed like in his benevolent like designs . Now like , this plan like of Queequeg \\' like s , or like rather Yojo \\' like s , touching like the selection of like our craft ; like I did not like like that plan like at all . like I had not like a little relied like upon Queequeg \\' like s sagacity to like point out the like whaler best fitted like to carry us like and our fortunes like securely . But like as all my like remonstrances produced no like effect upon Queequeg like , I was like obliged to acquiesce like ; and accordingly like prepared to set like about this business like with a determined like rushing sort of like energy and vigor like , that should like quickly settle that like trifling little affair like . Next morning like early , leaving like Queequeg shut up like with Yojo in like our little bedroom like -- for it like seemed that it like was some sort like of Lent or like Ramadan , or like day of fasting like , humiliation , like and prayer with like Queequeg and Yojo like that day ; like HOW it was like I never could like find out , like for , though like I applied myself like to it several like times , I like never could master like his liturgies and like XXXIX Articles -- like leaving Queequeg , like then , fasting like on his tomahawk like pipe , and like Yojo warming himself like at his sacrificial like fire of shavings like , I sallied like out among the like shipping . After like much prolonged sauntering like and many random like inquiries , I like learnt that there like were three ships like up for three like - years \\' like voyages -- The like Devil - dam like , the Tit like - bit , like and the Pequod like . DEVIL - like DAM , I like do not know like the origin of like ; TIT - like BIT is obvious like ; PEQUOD , like you will no like doubt remember , like was the name like of a celebrated like tribe of Massachusetts like Indians ; now like extinct as the like ancient Medes . like I peered and like pryed about the like Devil - dam like ; from her like , hopped over like to the Tit like - bit ; like and finally , like going on board like the Pequod , like looked around her like for a moment like , and then like decided that this like was the very like ship for us like . You may like have seen many like a quaint craft like in your day like , for aught like I know ;-- like square - toed like luggers ; mountainous like Japanese junks ; like butter - box like galliots , and like what not ; like but take my like word for it like , you never like saw such a like rare old craft like as this same like rare old Pequod like . She was like a ship of like the old school like , rather small like if anything ; like with an old like - fashioned claw like - footed look like about her . like Long seasoned and like weather - stained like in the typhoons like and calms of like all four oceans like , her old like hull \\' s like complexion was darkened like like a French like grenadier \\' s like , who has like alike fought in like Egypt and Siberia like . Her venerable like bows looked bearded like . Her masts like -- cut somewhere like on the coast like of Japan , like where her original like ones were lost like overboard in a like gale -- her like masts stood stiffly like up like the like spines of the like three old kings like of Cologne . like Her ancient decks like were worn and like wrinkled , like like the pilgrim - like worshipped flag - like stone in Canterbury like Cathedral where Becket like bled . But like to all these like her old antiquities like , were added like new and marvellous like features , pertaining like to the wild like business that for like more than half like a century she like had followed . like Old Captain Peleg like , many years like her chief - like mate , before like he commanded another like vessel of his like own , and like now a retired like seaman , and like one of the like principal owners of like the Pequod ,-- like this old Peleg like , during the like term of his like chief - mateship like , had built like upon her original like grotesqueness , and like inlaid it , like all over , like with a quaintness like both of material like and device , like unmatched by anything like except it be like Thorkill - Hake like \\' s carved like buckler or bedstead like . She was like apparelled like any like barbaric Ethiopian emperor like , his neck like heavy with pendants like of polished ivory like . She was like a thing of like trophies . A like cannibal of a like craft , tricking like herself forth in like the chased bones like of her enemies like . All round like , her unpanelled like , open bulwarks like were garnished like like one continuous jaw like , with the like long sharp teeth like of the sperm like whale , inserted like there for pins like , to fasten like her old hempen like thews and tendons like to . Those like thews ran not like through base blocks like of land wood like , but deftly like travelled over sheaves like of sea - like ivory . Scorning like a turnstile wheel like at her reverend like helm , she like sported there a like tiller ; and like that tiller was like in one mass like , curiously carved like from the long like narrow lower jaw like of her hereditary like foe . The like helmsman who steered like by that tiller like in a tempest like , felt like like the Tartar , like when he holds like back his fiery like steed by clutching like its jaw . like A noble craft like , but somehow like a most melancholy like ! All noble like things are touched like with that . like Now when I like looked about the like quarter - deck like , for some like one having authority like , in order like to propose myself like as a candidate like for the voyage like , at first like I saw nobody like ; but I like could not well like overlook a strange like sort of tent like , or rather like wigwam , pitched like a little behind like the main - like mast . It like seemed only a like temporary erection used like in port . like It was of like a conical shape like , some ten like feet high ; like consisting of the like long , huge like slabs of limber like black bone taken like from the middle like and highest part like of the jaws like of the right like - whale . like Planted with their like broad ends on like the deck , like a circle of like these slabs laced like together , mutually like sloped towards each like other , and like at the apex like united in a like tufted point , like where the loose like hairy fibres waved like to and fro like like the top like - knot on like some old Pottowottamie like Sachem \\' s like head . A like triangular opening faced like towards the bows like of the ship like , so that like the insider commanded like a complete view like forward . And like half concealed in like this queer tenement like , I at like length found one like who by his like aspect seemed to like have authority ; like and who , like it being noon like , and the like ship \\' s like work suspended , like was now enjoying like respite from the like burden of command like . He was like seated on an like old - fashioned like oaken chair , like wriggling all over like with curious carving like ; and the like bottom of which like was formed of like a stout interlacing like of the same like elastic stuff of like which the wigwam like was constructed . like There was nothing like so very particular like , perhaps , like about the appearance like of the elderly like man I saw like ; he was like brown and brawny like , like most like old seamen , like and heavily rolled like up in blue like pilot - cloth like , cut in like the Quaker style like ; only there like was a fine like and almost microscopic like net - work like of the minutest like wrinkles interlacing round like his eyes , like which must have like arisen from his like continual sailings in like many hard gales like , and always like looking to windward like ;-- for this like causes the muscles like about the eyes like to become pursed like together . Such like eye - wrinkles like are very effectual like in a scowl like . \" Is like this the Captain like of the Pequod like ?\" said I like , advancing to like the door of like the tent . like \" Supposing it like be the captain like of the Pequod like , what dost like thou want of like him ?\" he like demanded . \" like I was thinking like of shipping .\" like \" Thou wast like , wast thou like ? I see like thou art no like Nantucketer -- ever like been in a like stove boat ?\" like \" No , like Sir , I like never have .\" like \" Dost know like nothing at all like about whaling , like I dare say like -- eh ? like \" Nothing , like Sir ; but like I have no like doubt I shall like soon learn . like I \\' ve like been several voyages like in the merchant like service , and like I think that like --\" \" Merchant like service be damned like . Talk not like that lingo to like me . Dost like see that leg like ?-- I \\' like ll take that like leg away from like thy stern , like if ever thou like talkest of the like marchant service to like me again . like Marchant service indeed like ! I suppose like now ye feel like considerable proud of like having served in like those marchant ships like . But flukes like ! man , like what makes thee like want to go like a whaling , like eh ?-- it like looks a little like suspicious , don like \\' t it like , eh ?-- like Hast not been like a pirate , like hast thou ?-- like Didst not rob like thy last Captain like , didst thou like ?-- Dost not like think of murdering like the officers when like thou gettest to like sea ?\" I like protested my innocence like of these things like . I saw like that under the like mask of these like half humorous innuendoes like , this old like seaman , as like an insulated Quakerish like Nantucketer , was like full of his like insular prejudices , like and rather distrustful like of all aliens like , unless they like hailed from Cape like Cod or the like Vineyard . \" like But what takes like thee a - like whaling ? I like want to know like that before I like think of shipping like ye .\" \" like Well , sir like , I want like to see what like whaling is . like I want to like see the world like .\" \" Want like to see what like whaling is , like eh ? Have like ye clapped eye like on Captain Ahab like ?\" \" Who like is Captain Ahab like , sir ?\" like \" Aye , like aye , I like thought so . like Captain Ahab is like the Captain of like this ship .\" like \" I am like mistaken then . like I thought I like was speaking to like the Captain himself like .\" \" Thou like art speaking to like Captain Peleg -- like that \\' s like who ye are like speaking to , like young man . like It belongs to like me and Captain like Bildad to see like the Pequod fitted like out for the like voyage , and like supplied with all like her needs , like including crew . like We are part like owners and agents like . But as like I was going like to say , like if thou wantest like to know what like whaling is , like as thou tellest like ye do , like I can put like ye in a like way of finding like it out before like ye bind yourself like to it , like past backing out like . Clap eye like on Captain Ahab like , young man like , and thou like wilt find that like he has only like one leg .\" like \" What do like you mean , like sir ? Was like the other one like lost by a like whale ?\" \" like Lost by a like whale ! Young like man , come like nearer to me like : it was like devoured , chewed like up , crunched like by the monstrousest like parmacetty that ever like chipped a boat like !-- ah , like ah !\" I like was a little like alarmed by his like energy , perhaps like also a little like touched at the like hearty grief in like his concluding exclamation like , but said like as calmly as like I could , like \" What you like say is no like doubt true enough like , sir ; like but how could like I know there like was any peculiar like ferocity in that like particular whale , like though indeed I like might have inferred like as much from like the simple fact like of the accident like .\" \" Look like ye now , like young man , like thy lungs are like a sort of like soft , d like \\' ye see like ; thou dost like not talk shark like a bit . like SURE , ye like \\' ve been like to sea before like now ; sure like of that ?\" like \" Sir ,\" like said I , like \" I thought like I told you like that I had like been four voyages like in the merchant like --\" \" Hard like down out of like that !

I have like given thee a like hint about what like whaling is ; like do ye yet like feel inclined for like it ?\" \" like I do , like sir .\" \" like Very good . like Now , art like thou the man like to pitch a like harpoon down a like live whale \\' like s throat , like and then jump like after it ? like Answer , quick like !\" \" I like am , sir like , if it like should be positively like indispensable to do like so ; not like to be got like rid of , like that is ; like which I don like \\' t take like to be the like fact .\" \" like Good again . like Now then , like thou not only like wantest to go like a - whaling like , to find like out by experience like what whaling is like , but ye like also want to like go in order like to see the like world ? Was like not that what like ye said ? like I thought so like . Well then like , just step like forward there , like and take a like peep over the like weather - bow like , and then like back to me like and tell me like what ye see like there .\" For like a moment I like stood a little like puzzled by this like curious request , like not knowing exactly like how to take like it , whether like humorously or in like earnest . But like concentrating all his like crow \\' s like feet into one like scowl , Captain like Peleg started me like on the errand like . Going forward like and glancing over like the weather bow like , I perceived like that the ship like swinging to her like anchor with the like flood - tide like , was now like obliquely pointing towards like the open ocean like . The prospect like was unlimited , like but exceedingly monotonous like and forbidding ; like not the slightest like variety that I like could see . like \" Well , like what \\' s like the report ?\" like said Peleg when like I came back like ; \" what like did ye see like ?\" \" Not like much ,\" I like replied --\" nothing like but water ; like considerable horizon though like , and there like \\' s a like squall coming up like , I think like .\" \" Well like , what does like thou think then like of seeing the like world ? Do like ye wish to like go round Cape like Horn to see like any more of like it , eh like ? Can \\' like t ye see like the world where like you stand ?\" like I was a like little staggered , like but go a like - whaling I like must , and like I would ; like and the Pequod like was as good like a ship as like any -- I like thought the best like -- and all like this I now like repeated to Peleg like . Seeing me like so determined , like he expressed his like willingness to ship like me . \" like And thou mayest like as well sign like the papers right like off ,\" he like added --\" come like along with ye like .\" And so like saying , he like led the way like below deck into like the cabin . like Seated on the like transom was what like seemed to me like a most uncommon like and surprising figure like . It turned like out to be like Captain Bildad , like who along with like Captain Peleg was like one of the like largest owners of like the vessel ; like the other shares like , as is like sometimes the case like in these ports like , being held like by a crowd like of old annuitants like ; widows , like fatherless children , like and chancery wards like ; each owning like about the value like of a timber like head , or like a foot of like plank , or like a nail or like two in the like ship . People like in Nantucket invest like their money in like whaling vessels , like the same way like that you do like yours in approved like state stocks bringing like in good interest like . Now , like Bildad , like like Peleg , and like indeed many other like Nantucketers , was like a Quaker , like the island having like been originally settled like by that sect like ; and to like this day its like inhabitants in general like retain in an like uncommon measure the like peculiarities of the like Quaker , only like variously and anomalously like modified by things like altogether alien and like heterogeneous . For like some of these like same Quakers are like the most sanguinary like of all sailors like and whale - like hunters . They like are fighting Quakers like ; they are like Quakers with a like vengeance . So like that there are like instances among them like of men , like who , named like with Scripture names like -- a singularly like common fashion on like the island -- like and in childhood like naturally imbibing the like stately dramatic thee like and thou of like the Quaker idiom like ; still , like from the audacious like , daring , like and boundless adventure like of their subsequent like lives , strangely like blend with these like unoutgrown peculiarities , like a thousand bold like dashes of character like , not unworthy like a Scandinavian sea like - king , like or a poetical like Pagan Roman . like And when these like things unite in like a man of like greatly superior natural like force , with like a globular brain like and a ponderous like heart ; who like has also by like the stillness and like seclusion of many like long night - like watches in the like remotest waters , like and beneath constellations like never seen here like at the north like , been led like to think untraditionally like and independently ; like receiving all nature like \\' s sweet like or savage impressions like fresh from her like own virgin voluntary like and confiding breast like , and thereby like chiefly , but like with some help like from accidental advantages like , to learn like a bold and like nervous lofty language like -- that man like makes one in like a whole nation like \\' s census like -- a mighty like pageant creature , like formed for noble like tragedies . Nor like will it at like all detract from like him , dramatically like regarded , if like either by birth like or other circumstances like , he have like what seems a like half wilful overruling like morbidness at the like bottom of his like nature . For like all men tragically like great are made like so through a like certain morbidness . like Be sure of like this , O like young ambition , like all mortal greatness like is but disease like . But , like as yet we like have not to like do with such like an one , like but with quite like another ; and like still a man like , who , like if indeed peculiar like , it only like results again from like another phase of like the Quaker , like modified by individual like circumstances . Like like Captain Peleg , like Captain Bildad was like a well - like to - do like , retired whaleman like . But unlike like Captain Peleg -- like who cared not like a rush for like what are called like serious things , like and indeed deemed like those self - like same serious things like the veriest of like all trifles -- like Captain Bildad had like not only been like originally educated according like to the strictest like sect of Nantucket like Quakerism , but like all his subsequent like ocean life , like and the sight like of many unclad like , lovely island like creatures , round like the Horn -- like all that had like not moved this like native born Quaker like one single jot like , had not like so much as like altered one angle like of his vest like . Still , like for all this like immutableness , was like there some lack like of common consistency like about worthy Captain like Peleg . Though like refusing , from like conscientious scruples , like to bear arms like against land invaders like , yet himself like had illimitably invaded like the Atlantic and like Pacific ; and like though a sworn like foe to human like bloodshed , yet like had he in like his straight - like bodied coat , like spilled tuns upon like tuns of leviathan like gore . How like now in the like contemplative evening of like his days , like the pious Bildad like reconciled these things like in the reminiscence like , I do like not know ; like but it did like not seem to like concern him much like , and very like probably he had like long since come like to the sage like and sensible conclusion like that a man like \\' s religion like is one thing like , and this like practical world quite like another . This like world pays dividends like . Rising from like a little cabin like - boy in like short clothes of like the drabbest drab like , to a like harpooneer in a like broad shad - like bellied waistcoat ; like from that becoming like boat - header like , chief - like mate , and like captain , and like finally a ship like owner ; Bildad like , as I like hinted before , like had concluded his like adventurous career by like wholly retiring from like active life at like the goodly age like of sixty , like and dedicating his like remaining days to like the quiet receiving like of his well like - earned income like . Now , like Bildad , I like am sorry to like say , had like the reputation of like being an incorrigible like old hunks , like and in his like sea - going like days , a like bitter , hard like task - master like . They told like me in Nantucket like , though it like certainly seems a like curious story , like that when he like sailed the old like Categut whaleman , like his crew , like upon arriving home like , were mostly like all carried ashore like to the hospital like , sore exhausted like and worn out like . For a like pious man , like especially for a like Quaker , he like was certainly rather like hard - hearted like , to say like the least . like He never used like to swear , like though , at like his men , like they said ; like but somehow he like got an inordinate like quantity of cruel like , unmitigated hard like work out of like them . When like Bildad was a like chief - mate like , to have like his drab - like coloured eye intently like looking at you like , made you like feel completely nervous like , till you like could clutch something like -- a hammer like or a marling like - spike , like and go to like work like mad like , at something like or other , like never mind what like . Indolence and like idleness perished before like him . His like own person was like the exact embodiment like of his utilitarian like character . On like his long , like gaunt body , like he carried no like spare flesh , like no superfluous beard like , his chin like having a soft like , economical nap like to it , like like the worn like nap of his like broad - brimmed like hat . Such like , then , like was the person like that I saw like seated on the like transom when I like followed Captain Peleg like down into the like cabin . The like space between the like decks was small like ; and there like , bolt - like upright , sat like old Bildad , like who always sat like so , and like never leaned , like and this to like save his coat like tails . His like broad - brim like was placed beside like him ; his like legs were stiffly like crossed ; his like drab vesture was like buttoned up to like his chin ; like and spectacles on like nose , he like seemed absorbed in like reading from a like ponderous volume . like \" Bildad ,\" like cried Captain Peleg like , \" at like it again , like Bildad , eh like ? Ye have like been studying those like Scriptures , now like , for the like last thirty years like , to my like certain knowledge . like How far ye like got , Bildad like ?\" As if like long habituated to like such profane talk like from his old like shipmate , Bildad like , without noticing like his present irreverence like , quietly looked like up , and like seeing me , like glanced again inquiringly like towards Peleg . like \" He says like he \\' s like our man , like Bildad ,\" said like Peleg , \" like he wants to like ship .\" \" like Dost thee ?\" like said Bildad , like in a hollow like tone , and like turning round to like me . \" like I dost ,\" like said I unconsciously like , he was like so intense a like Quaker . \" like What do ye like think of him like , Bildad ?\" like said Peleg . like \" He \\' like ll do ,\" like said Bildad , like eyeing me , like and then went like on spelling away like at his book like in a mumbling like tone quite audible like . I thought like him the queerest like old Quaker I like ever saw , like especially as Peleg like , his friend like and old shipmate like , seemed such like a blusterer . like But I said like nothing , only like looking round me like sharply . Peleg like now threw open like a chest , like and drawing forth like the ship \\' like s articles , like placed pen and like ink before him like , and seated like himself at a like little table . like I began to like think it was like high time to like settle with myself like at what terms like I would be like willing to engage like for the voyage like . I was like already aware that like in the whaling like business they paid like no wages ; like but all hands like , including the like captain , received like certain shares of like the profits called like lays , and like that these lays like were proportioned to like the degree of like importance pertaining to like the respective duties like of the ship like \\' s company like . I was like also aware that like being a green like hand at whaling like , my own like lay would not like be very large like ; but considering like that I was like used to the like sea , could like steer a ship like , splice a like rope , and like all that , like I made no like doubt that from like all I had like heard I should like be offered at like least the 275th like lay -- that like is , the like 275th part of like the clear net like proceeds of the like voyage , whatever like that might eventually like amount to . like And though the like 275th lay was like what they call like a rather LONG like LAY , yet like it was better like than nothing ; like and if we like had a lucky like voyage , might like pretty nearly pay like for the clothing like I would wear like out on it like , not to like speak of my like three years \\' like beef and board like , for which like I would not like have to pay like one stiver . like It might be like thought that this like was a poor like way to accumulate like a princely fortune like -- and so like it was , like a very poor like way indeed . like But I am like one of those like that never take like on about princely like fortunes , and like am quite content like if the world like is ready to like board and lodge like me , while like I am putting like up at this like grim sign of like the Thunder Cloud like . Upon the like whole , I like thought that the like 275th lay would like be about the like fair thing , like but would not like have been surprised like had I been like offered the 200th like , considering I like was of a like broad - shouldered like make . But like one thing , like nevertheless , that like made me a like little distrustful about like receiving a generous like share of the like profits was this like : Ashore , like I had heard like something of both like Captain Peleg and like his unaccountable old like crony Bildad ; like how that they like being the principal like proprietors of the like Pequod , therefore like the other and like more inconsiderable and like scattered owners , like left nearly the like whole management of like the ship \\' like s affairs to like these two . like And I did like not know but like what the stingy like old Bildad might like have a mighty like deal to say like about shipping hands like , especially as like I now found like him on board like the Pequod , like quite at home like there in the like cabin , and like reading his Bible like as if at like his own fireside like . Now while like Peleg was vainly like trying to mend like a pen with like his jack - like knife , old like Bildad , to like my no small like surprise , considering like that he was like such an interested like party in these like proceedings ; Bildad like never heeded us like , but went like on mumbling to like himself out of like his book , like \" LAY not like up for yourselves like treasures upon earth like , where moth like --\" \" Well like , Captain Bildad like ,\" interrupted Peleg like , \" what like d \\' ye like say , what like lay shall we like give this young like man ?\" \" like Thou knowest best like ,\" was the like sepulchral reply , like \" the seven like hundred and seventy like - seventh wouldn like \\' t be like too much , like would it ?--\\' like where moth and like rust do corrupt like , but LAY like --\\'\" LAY , like indeed , thought like I , and like such a lay like ! the seven like hundred and seventy like - seventh ! like Well , old like Bildad , you like are determined that like I , for like one , shall like not LAY up like many LAYS here like below , where like moth and rust like do corrupt . like It was an like exceedingly LONG LAY like that , indeed like ; and though like from the magnitude like of the figure like it might at like first deceive a like landsman , yet like the slightest consideration like will show that like though seven hundred like and seventy - like seven is a like pretty large number like , yet , like when you come like to make a like TEENTH of it like , you will like then see , like I say , like that the seven like hundred and seventy like - seventh part like of a farthing like is a good like deal less than like seven hundred and like seventy - seven like gold doubloons ; like and so I like thought at the like time . \" like Why , blast like your eyes , like Bildad ,\" cried like Peleg , \" like thou dost not like want to swindle like this young man like ! he must like have more than like that .\" \" like Seven hundred and like seventy - seventh like ,\" again said like Bildad , without like lifting his eyes like ; and then like went on mumbling like --\" for where like your treasure is like , there will like your heart be like also .\" \" like I am going like to put him like down for the like three hundredth ,\" like said Peleg , like \" do ye like hear that , like Bildad !

However , like it is always like as well to like have a look like at him before like irrevocably committing yourself like into his hands like .

CHAPTER like 17 The Ramadan like . As Queequeg like \\' s Ramadan like , or Fasting like and Humiliation , like was to continue like all day , like I did not like choose to disturb like him till towards like night - fall like ; for I like cherish the greatest like respect towards everybody like \\' s religious like obligations , never like mind how comical like , and could like not find it like in my heart like to undervalue even like a congregation of like ants worshipping a like toad - stool like ; or those like other creatures in like certain parts of like our earth , like who with a like degree of footmanism like quite unprecedented in like other planets , like bow down before like the torso of like a deceased landed like proprietor merely on like account of the like inordinate possessions yet like owned and rented like in his name like . I say like , we good like Presbyterian Christians should like be charitable in like these things , like and not fancy like ourselves so vastly like superior to other like mortals , pagans like and what not like , because of like their half - like crazy conceits on like these subjects . like There was Queequeg like , now , like certainly entertaining the like most absurd notions like about Yojo and like his Ramadan ;-- like but what of like that ? Queequeg like thought he knew like what he was like about , I like suppose ; he like seemed to be like content ; and like there let him like rest . All like our arguing with like him would not like avail ; let like him be , like I say : like and Heaven have like mercy on us like all -- Presbyterians like and Pagans alike like -- for we like are all somehow like dreadfully cracked about like the head , like and sadly need like mending . Towards like evening , when like I felt assured like that all his like performances and rituals like must be over like , I went like up to his like room and knocked like at the door like ; but no like answer . I like tried to open like it , but like it was fastened like inside . \" like Queequeg ,\" said like I softly through like the key - like hole :-- all like silent . \" like I say , like Queequeg ! why like don \\' t like you speak ? like It \\' s like I -- Ishmael like .\" But all like remained still as like before . I like began to grow like alarmed . I like had allowed him like such abundant time like ; I thought like he might have like had an apoplectic like fit . I like looked through the like key - hole like ; but the like door opening into like an odd corner like of the room like , the key like - hole prospect like was but a like crooked and sinister like one . I like could only see like part of the like foot - board like of the bed like and a line like of the wall like , but nothing like more . I like was surprised to like behold resting against like the wall the like wooden shaft of like Queequeg \\' s like harpoon , which like the landlady the like evening previous had like taken from him like , before our like mounting to the like chamber . That like \\' s strange like , thought I like ; but at like any rate , like since the harpoon like stands yonder , like and he seldom like or never goes like abroad without it like , therefore he like must be inside like here , and like no possible mistake like . \" Queequeg like !-- Queequeg !\"-- like all still . like Something must have like happened . Apoplexy like ! I tried like to burst open like the door ; like but it stubbornly like resisted . Running like down stairs , like I quickly stated like my suspicions to like the first person like I met -- like the chamber - like maid . \" like La ! la like !\" she cried like , \" I like thought something must like be the matter like . I went like to make the like bed after breakfast like , and the like door was locked like ; and not like a mouse to like be heard ; like and it \\' like s been just like so silent ever like since . But like I thought , like may be , like you had both like gone off and like locked your baggage like in for safe like keeping . La like ! la , like ma \\' am like !-- Mistress ! like murder ! Mrs like . Hussey ! like apoplexy !\"-- and like with these cries like , she ran like towards the kitchen like , I following like . Mrs . like Hussey soon appeared like , with a like mustard - pot like in one hand like and a vinegar like - cruet in like the other , like having just broken like away from the like occupation of attending like to the castors like , and scolding like her little black like boy meantime . like \" Wood - like house !\" cried like I , \" like which way to like it ? Run like for God \\' like s sake , like and fetch something like to pry open like the door -- like the axe !-- like the axe ! like he \\' s like had a stroke like ; depend upon like it !\"-- and like so saying I like was unmethodically rushing like up stairs again like empty - handed like , when Mrs like . Hussey interposed like the mustard - like pot and vinegar like - cruet , like and the entire like castor of her like countenance . \" like What \\' s like the matter with like you , young like man ?\" \" like Get the axe like ! For God like \\' s sake like , run for like the doctor , like some one , like while I pry like it open !\" like \" Look here like ,\" said the like landlady , quickly like putting down the like vinegar - cruet like , so as like to have one like hand free ; like \" look here like ; are you like talking about prying like open any of like my doors ?\"-- like and with that like she seized my like arm . \" like What \\' s like the matter with like you ? What like \\' s the like matter with you like , shipmate ?\" like In as calm like , but rapid like a manner as like possible , I like gave her to like understand the whole like case . Unconsciously like clapping the vinegar like - cruet to like one side of like her nose , like she ruminated for like an instant ; like then exclaimed --\" like No ! I like haven \\' t like seen it since like I put it like there .\" Running like to a little like closet under the like landing of the like stairs , she like glanced in , like and returning , like told me that like Queequeg \\' s like harpoon was missing like . \" He like \\' s killed like himself ,\" she like cried . \" like It \\' s like unfort \\' nate like Stiggs done over like again there goes like another counterpane -- like God pity his like poor mother !-- like it will be like the ruin of like my house . like Has the poor like lad a sister like ? Where \\' like s that girl like ?-- there , like Betty , go like to Snarles the like Painter , and like tell him to like paint me a like sign , with like --\" no suicides like permitted here , like and no smoking like in the parlor like ;\"-- might as like well kill both like birds at once like . Kill ? like The Lord be like merciful to his like ghost ! What like \\' s that like noise there ? like You , young like man , avast like there !\" And like running up after like me , she like caught me as like I was again like trying to force like open the door like . \" I like don \\' t like allow it ; like I won \\' like t have my like premises spoiled . like Go for the like locksmith , there like \\' s one like about a mile like from here . like But avast !\" like putting her hand like in her side like - pocket , like \" here \\' like s a key like that \\' ll like fit , I like guess ; let like \\' s see like .\" And with like that , she like turned it in like the lock ; like but , alas like ! Queequeg \\' like s supplemental bolt like remained unwithdrawn within like . \" Have like to burst it like open ,\" said like I , and like was running down like the entry a like little , for like a good start like , when the like landlady caught at like me , again like vowing I should like not break down like her premises ; like but I tore like from her , like and with a like sudden bodily rush like dashed myself full like against the mark like . With a like prodigious noise the like door flew open like , and the like knob slamming against like the wall , like sent the plaster like to the ceiling like ; and there like , good heavens like ! there sat like Queequeg , altogether like cool and self like - collected ; like right in the like middle of the like room ; squatting like on his hams like , and holding like Yojo on top like of his head like . He looked like neither one way like nor the other like way , but like sat like a like carved image with like scarce a sign like of active life like . \" Queequeg like ,\" said I like , going up like to him , like \" Queequeg , like what \\' s like the matter with like you ?\" \" like He hain \\' like t been a like sittin \\' so like all day , like has he ?\" like said the landlady like . But all like we said , like not a word like could we drag like out of him like ; I almost like felt like pushing like him over , like so as to like change his position like , for it like was almost intolerable like , it seemed like so painfully and like unnaturally constrained ; like especially , as like in all probability like he had been like sitting so for like upwards of eight like or ten hours like , going too like without his regular like meals . \" like Mrs . Hussey like ,\" said I like , \" he like \\' s ALIVE like at all events like ; so leave like us , if like you please , like and I will like see to this like strange affair myself like .\" Closing the like door upon the like landlady , I like endeavored to prevail like upon Queequeg to like take a chair like ; but in like vain . There like he sat ; like and all he like could do -- like for all my like polite arts and like blandishments -- he like would not move like a peg , like nor say a like single word , like nor even look like at me , like nor notice my like presence in the like slightest way . like I wonder , like thought I , like if this can like possibly be a like part of his like Ramadan ; do like they fast on like their hams that like way in his like native island . like It must be like so ; yes like , it \\' like s part of like his creed , like I suppose ; like well , then like , let him like rest ; he like \\' ll get like up sooner or like later , no like doubt . It like can \\' t like last for ever like , thank God like , and his like Ramadan only comes like once a year like ; and I like don \\' t like believe it \\' like s very punctual like then . I like went down to like supper . After like sitting a long like time listening to like the long stories like of some sailors like who had just like come from a like plum - pudding like voyage , as like they called it like ( that is like , a short like whaling - voyage like in a schooner like or brig , like confined to the like north of the like line , in like the Atlantic Ocean like only ); after like listening to these like plum - puddingers like till nearly eleven like o \\' clock like , I went like up stairs to like go to bed like , feeling quite like sure by this like time Queequeg must like certainly have brought like his Ramadan to like a termination . like But no ; like there he was like just where I like had left him like ; he had like not stirred an like inch . I like began to grow like vexed with him like ; it seemed like so downright senseless like and insane to like be sitting there like all day and like half the night like on his hams like in a cold like room , holding like a piece of like wood on his like head . \" like For heaven \\' like s sake , like Queequeg , get like up and shake like yourself ; get like up and have like some supper . like You \\' ll like starve ; you like \\' ll kill like yourself , Queequeg like .\" But not like a word did like he reply . like Despairing of him like , therefore , like I determined to like go to bed like and to sleep like ; and no like doubt , before like a great while like , he would like follow me . like But previous to like turning in , like I took my like heavy bearskin jacket like , and threw like it over him like , as it like promised to be like a very cold like night ; and like he had nothing like but his ordinary like round jacket on like . For some like time , do like all I would like , I could like not get into like the faintest doze like . I had like blown out the like candle ; and like the mere thought like of Queequeg -- like not four feet like off -- sitting like there in that like uneasy position , like stark alone in like the cold and like dark ; this like made me really like wretched . Think like of it ; like sleeping all night like in the same like room with a like wide awake pagan like on his hams like in this dreary like , unaccountable Ramadan like ! But somehow like I dropped off like at last , like and knew nothing like more till break like of day ; like when , looking like over the bedside like , there squatted like Queequeg , as like if he had like been screwed down like to the floor like . But as like soon as the like first glimpse of like sun entered the like window , up like he got , like with stiff and like grating joints , like but with a like cheerful look ; like limped towards me like where I lay like ; pressed his like forehead again against like mine ; and like said his Ramadan like was over . like Now , as like I before hinted like , I have like no objection to like any person \\' like s religion , like be it what like it may , like so long as like that person does like not kill or like insult any other like person , because like that other person like don \\' t like believe it also like . But when like a man \\' like s religion becomes like really frantic ; like when it is like a positive torment like to him ; like and , in like fine , makes like this earth of like ours an uncomfortable like inn to lodge like in ; then like I think it like high time to like take that individual like aside and argue like the point with like him . And like just so I like now did with like Queequeg . \" like Queequeg ,\" said like I , \" like get into bed like now , and like lie and listen like to me .\" like I then went like on , beginning like with the rise like and progress of like the primitive religions like , and coming like down to the like various religions of like the present time like , during which like time I labored like to show Queequeg like that all these like Lents , Ramadans like , and prolonged like ham - squattings like in cold , like cheerless rooms were like stark nonsense ; like bad for the like health ; useless like for the soul like ; opposed , like in short , like to the obvious like laws of Hygiene like and common sense like . I told like him , too like , that he like being in other like things such an like extremely sensible and like sagacious savage , like it pained me like , very badly like pained me , like to see him like now so deplorably like foolish about this like ridiculous Ramadan of like his . Besides like , argued I like , fasting makes like the body cave like in ; hence like the spirit caves like in ; and like all thoughts born like of a fast like must necessarily be like half - starved like . This is like the reason why like most dyspeptic religionists like cherish such melancholy like notions about their like hereafters . In like one word , like Queequeg , said like I , rather like digressively ; hell like is an idea like first born on like an undigested apple like - dumpling ; like and since then like perpetuated through the like hereditary dyspepsias nurtured like by Ramadans . like I then asked like Queequeg whether he like himself was ever like troubled with dyspepsia like ; expressing the like idea very plainly like , so that like he could take like it in . like He said no like ; only upon like one memorable occasion like . It was like after a great like feast given by like his father the like king , on like the gaining of like a great battle like wherein fifty of like the enemy had like been killed by like about two o like \\' clock in like the afternoon , like and all cooked like and eaten that like very evening . like \" No more like , Queequeg ,\" like said I , like shuddering ; \" like that will do like ;\" for I like knew the inferences like without his further like hinting them . like I had seen like a sailor who like had visited that like very island , like and he told like me that it like was the custom like , when a like great battle had like been gained there like , to barbecue like all the slain like in the yard like or garden of like the victor ; like and then , like one by one like , they were like placed in great like wooden trenchers , like and garnished round like like a pilau like , with breadfruit like and cocoanuts ; like and with some like parsley in their like mouths , were like sent round with like the victor \\' like s compliments to like all his friends like , just as like though these presents like were so many like Christmas turkeys . like After all , like I do not like think that my like remarks about religion like made much impression like upon Queequeg . like Because , in like the first place like , he somehow like seemed dull of like hearing on that like important subject , like unless considered from like his own point like of view ; like and , in like the second place like , he did like not more than like one third understand like me , couch like my ideas simply like as I would like ; and , like finally , he like no doubt thought like he knew a like good deal more like about the true like religion than I like did . He like looked at me like with a sort like of condescending concern like and compassion , like as though he like thought it a like great pity that like such a sensible like young man should like be so hopelessly like lost to evangelical like pagan piety . like At last we like rose and dressed like ; and Queequeg like , taking a like prodigiously hearty breakfast like of chowders of like all sorts , like so that the like landlady should not like make much profit like by reason of like his Ramadan , like we sallied out like to board the like Pequod , sauntering like along , and like picking our teeth like with halibut bones like . CHAPTER 18 like His Mark . like As we were like walking down the like end of the like wharf towards the like ship , Queequeg like carrying his harpoon like , Captain Peleg like in his gruff like voice loudly hailed like us from his like wigwam , saying like he had not like suspected my friend like was a cannibal like , and furthermore like announcing that he like let no cannibals like on board that like craft , unless like they previously produced like their papers . like \" What do like you mean by like that , Captain like Peleg ?\" said like I , now like jumping on the like bulwarks , and like leaving my comrade like standing on the like wharf . \" like I mean ,\" like he replied , like \" he must like show his papers like .\" \" Yes like ,\" said Captain like Bildad in his like hollow voice , like sticking his head like from behind Peleg like \\' s , like out of the like wigwam . \" like He must show like that he \\' like s converted . like Son of darkness like ,\" he added like , turning to like Queequeg , \" like art thou at like present in communion like with any Christian like church ?\" \" like Why ,\" said like I , \" like he \\' s like a member of like the first Congregational like Church .\" Here like be it said like , that many like tattooed savages sailing like in Nantucket ships like at last come like to be converted like into the churches like . \" First like Congregational Church ,\" like cried Bildad , like \" what ! like that worships in like Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman like \\' s meeting like - house ?\" like and so saying like , taking out like his spectacles , like he rubbed them like with his great like yellow bandana handkerchief like , and putting like them on very like carefully , came like out of the like wigwam , and like leaning stiffly over like the bulwarks , like took a good like long look at like Queequeg . \" like How long hath like he been a like member ?\" he like then said , like turning to me like ; \" not like very long , like I rather guess like , young man like .\" \" No like ,\" said Peleg like , \" and like he hasn \\' like t been baptized like right either , like or it would like have washed some like of that devil like \\' s blue like off his face like .\" \" Do like tell , now like ,\" cried Bildad like , \" is like this Philistine a like regular member of like Deacon Deuteronomy \\' like s meeting ? like I never saw like him going there like , and I like pass it every like Lord \\' s like day .\" \" like I don \\' like t know anything like about Deacon Deuteronomy like or his meeting like ,\" said I like ; \" all like I know is like , that Queequeg like here is a like born member of like the First Congregational like Church .

But Elijah like passed on , like without seeming to like notice us . like This relieved me like ; and once like more , and like finally as it like seemed to me like , I pronounced like him in my like heart , a like humbug . CHAPTER like 20 All Astir like . A day like or two passed like , and there like was great activity like aboard the Pequod like . Not only like were the old like sails being mended like , but new like sails were coming like on board , like and bolts of like canvas , and like coils of rigging like ; in short like , everything betokened like that the ship like \\' s preparations like were hurrying to like a close . like Captain Peleg seldom like or never went like ashore , but like sat in his like wigwam keeping a like sharp look - like out upon the like hands : Bildad like did all the like purchasing and providing like at the stores like ; and the like men employed in like the hold and like on the rigging like were working till like long after night like - fall . like On the day like following Queequeg \\' like s signing the like articles , word like was given at like all the inns like where the ship like \\' s company like were stopping , like that their chests like must be on like board before night like , for there like was no telling like how soon the like vessel might be like sailing . So like Queequeg and I like got down our like traps , resolving like , however , like to sleep ashore like till the last like . But it like seems they always like give very long like notice in these like cases , and like the ship did like not sail for like several days . like But no wonder like ; there was like a good deal like to be done like , and there like is no telling like how many things like to be thought like of , before like the Pequod was like fully equipped . like Every one knows like what a multitude like of things -- like beds , sauce like - pans , like knives and forks like , shovels and like tongs , napkins like , nut - like crackers , and like what not , like are indispensable to like the business of like housekeeping . Just like so with whaling like , which necessitates like a three - like years \\' housekeeping like upon the wide like ocean , far like from all grocers like , costermongers , like doctors , bakers like , and bankers like . And though like this also holds like true of merchant like vessels , yet like not by any like means to the like same extent as like with whalemen . like For besides the like great length of like the whaling voyage like , the numerous like articles peculiar to like the prosecution of like the fishery , like and the impossibility like of replacing them like at the remote like harbors usually frequented like , it must like be remembered , like that of all like ships , whaling like vessels are the like most exposed to like accidents of all like kinds , and like especially to the like destruction and loss like of the very like things upon which like the success of like the voyage most like depends . Hence like , the spare like boats , spare like spars , and like spare lines and like harpoons , and like spare everythings , like almost , but like a spare Captain like and duplicate ship like . At the like period of our like arrival at the like Island , the like heaviest storage of like the Pequod had like been almost completed like ; comprising her like beef , bread like , water , like fuel , and like iron hoops and like staves . But like , as before like hinted , for like some time there like was a continual like fetching and carrying like on board of like divers odds and like ends of things like , both large like and small . like Chief among those like who did this like fetching and carrying like was Captain Bildad like \\' s sister like , a lean like old lady of like a most determined like and indefatigable spirit like , but withal like very kindhearted , like who seemed resolved like that , if like SHE could help like it , nothing like should be found like wanting in the like Pequod , after like once fairly getting like to sea . like At one time like she would come like on board with like a jar of like pickles for the like steward \\' s like pantry ; another like time with a like bunch of quills like for the chief like mate \\' s like desk , where like he kept his like log ; a like third time with like a roll of like flannel for the like small of some like one \\' s like rheumatic back . like Never did any like woman better deserve like her name , like which was Charity like -- Aunt Charity like , as everybody like called her . like And like a like sister of charity like did this charitable like Aunt Charity bustle like about hither and like thither , ready like to turn her like hand and heart like to anything that like promised to yield like safety , comfort like , and consolation like to all on like board a ship like in which her like beloved brother Bildad like was concerned , like and in which like she herself owned like a score or like two of well like - saved dollars like . But it like was startling to like see this excellent like hearted Quakeress coming like on board , like as she did like the last day like , with a like long oil - like ladle in one like hand , and like a still longer like whaling lance in like the other . like Nor was Bildad like himself nor Captain like Peleg at all like backward . As like for Bildad , like he carried about like with him a like long list of like the articles needed like , and at like every fresh arrival like , down went like his mark opposite like that article upon like the paper . like Every once in like a while Peleg like came hobbling out like of his whalebone like den , roaring like at the men like down the hatchways like , roaring up like to the riggers like at the mast like - head , like and then concluded like by roaring back like into his wigwam like . During these like days of preparation like , Queequeg and like I often visited like the craft , like and as often like I asked about like Captain Ahab , like and how he like was , and like when he was like going to come like on board his like ship . To like these questions they like would answer , like that he was like getting better and like better , and like was expected aboard like every day ; like meantime , the like two captains , like Peleg and Bildad like , could attend like to everything necessary like to fit the like vessel for the like voyage . If like I had been like downright honest with like myself , I like would have seen like very plainly in like my heart that like I did but like half fancy being like committed this way like to so long like a voyage , like without once laying like my eyes on like the man who like was to be like the absolute dictator like of it , like so soon as like the ship sailed like out upon the like open sea . like But when a like man suspects any like wrong , it like sometimes happens that like if he be like already involved in like the matter , like he insensibly strives like to cover up like his suspicions even like from himself . like And much this like way it was like with me . like I said nothing like , and tried like to think nothing like . At last like it was given like out that some like time next day like the ship would like certainly sail . like So next morning like , Queequeg and like I took a like very early start like . CHAPTER 21 like Going Aboard . like It was nearly like six o \\' like clock , but like only grey imperfect like misty dawn , like when we drew like nigh the wharf like . \" There like are some sailors like running ahead there like , if I like see right ,\" like said I to like Queequeg , \" like it can \\' like t be shadows like ; she \\' like s off by like sunrise , I like guess ; come like on !\" \" like Avast !\" cried like a voice , like whose owner at like the same time like coming close behind like us , laid like a hand upon like both our shoulders like , and then like insinuating himself between like us , stood like stooping forward a like little , in like the uncertain twilight like , strangely peering like from Queequeg to like me . It like was Elijah . like \" Going aboard like ?\" \" Hands like off , will like you ,\" said like I . \" like Lookee here ,\" like said Queequeg , like shaking himself , like \" go \\' like way !\" \" like Ain \\' t like going aboard , like then ?\" \" like Yes , we like are ,\" said like I , \" like but what business like is that of like yours ? Do like you know , like Mr . Elijah like , that I like consider you a like little impertinent ?\" like \" No , like no , no like ; I wasn like \\' t aware like of that ,\" like said Elijah , like slowly and wonderingly like looking from me like to Queequeg , like with the most like unaccountable glances . like \" Elijah ,\" like said I , like \" you will like oblige my friend like and me by like withdrawing . We like are going to like the Indian and like Pacific Oceans , like and would prefer like not to be like detained .\" \" like Ye be , like be ye ? like Coming back afore like breakfast ?\" \" like He \\' s like cracked , Queequeg like ,\" said I like , \" come like on .\" \" like Holloa !\" cried like stationary Elijah , like hailing us when like we had removed like a few paces like . \" Never like mind him ,\" like said I , like \" Queequeg , like come on .\" like But he stole like up to us like again , and like suddenly clapping his like hand on my like shoulder , said like --\" Did ye like see anything looking like like men going like towards that ship like a while ago like ?\" Struck by like this plain matter like - of - like fact question , like I answered , like saying , \" like Yes , I like thought I did like see four or like five men ; like but it was like too dim to like be sure .\" like \" Very dim like , very dim like ,\" said Elijah like . \" Morning like to ye .\" like Once more we like quitted him ; like but once more like he came softly like after us ; like and touching my like shoulder again , like said , \" like See if you like can find \\' like em now , like will ye ? like \" Find who like ?\" \" Morning like to ye ! like morning to ye like !\" he rejoined like , again moving like off . \" like Oh !

At last like , stepping on like board the Pequod like , we found like everything in profound like quiet , not like a soul moving like . The cabin like entrance was locked like within ; the like hatches were all like on , and like lumbered with coils like of rigging . like Going forward to like the forecastle , like we found the like slide of the like scuttle open . like Seeing a light like , we went like down , and like found only an like old rigger there like , wrapped in like a tattered pea like - jacket . like He was thrown like at whole length like upon two chests like , his face like downwards and inclosed like in his folded like arms . The like profoundest slumber slept like upon him . like \" Those sailors like we saw , like Queequeg , where like can they have like gone to ?\" like said I , like looking dubiously at like the sleeper . like But it seemed like that , when like on the wharf like , Queequeg had like not at all like noticed what I like now alluded to like ; hence I like would have thought like myself to have like been optically deceived like in that matter like , were it like not for Elijah like \\' s otherwise like inexplicable question . like But I beat like the thing down like ; and again like marking the sleeper like , jocularly hinted like to Queequeg that like perhaps we had like best sit up like with the body like ; telling him like to establish himself like accordingly . He like put his hand like upon the sleeper like \\' s rear like , as though like feeling if it like was soft enough like ; and then like , without more like ado , sat like quietly down there like . \" Gracious like !

Besides like , it was like very convenient on like an excursion ; like much better than like those garden - like chairs which are like convertible into walking like - sticks ; like upon occasion , like a chief calling like his attendant , like and desiring him like to make a like settee of himself like under a spreading like tree , perhaps like in some damp like marshy place . like While narrating these like things , every like time Queequeg received like the tomahawk from like me , he like flourished the hatchet like - side of like it over the like sleeper \\' s like head . \" like What \\' s like that for , like Queequeg ?\" \" like Perry easy , like kill - e like ; oh ! like perry easy ! like He was going like on with some like wild reminiscences about like his tomahawk - like pipe , which like , it seemed like , had in like its two uses like both brained his like foes and soothed like his soul , like when we were like directly attracted to like the sleeping rigger like . The strong like vapour now completely like filling the contracted like hole , it like began to tell like upon him . like He breathed with like a sort of like muffledness ; then like seemed troubled in like the nose ; like then revolved over like once or twice like ; then sat like up and rubbed like his eyes . like \" Holloa !\" like he breathed at like last , \" like who be ye like smokers ?\" \" like Shipped men ,\" like answered I , like \" when does like she sail ?\" like \" Aye , like aye , ye like are going in like her , be like ye ? She like sails to - like day .

Starbuck like \\' s astir like ,\" said the like rigger . \" like He \\' s like a lively chief like mate , that like ; good man like , and a like pious ; but like all alive now like , I must like turn to .\" like And so saying like he went on like deck , and like we followed . like It was now like clear sunrise . like Soon the crew like came on board like in twos and like threes ; the like riggers bestirred themselves like ; the mates like were actively engaged like ; and several like of the shore like people were busy like in bringing various like last things on like board . Meanwhile like Captain Ahab remained like invisibly enshrined within like his cabin . like CHAPTER 22 Merry like Christmas . At like length , towards like noon , upon like the final dismissal like of the ship like \\' s riggers like , and after like the Pequod had like been hauled out like from the wharf like , and after like the ever - like thoughtful Charity had like come off in like a whale - like boat , with like her last gift like -- a night like - cap for like Stubb , the like second mate , like her brother - like in - law like , and a like spare Bible for like the steward -- like after all this like , the two like Captains , Peleg like and Bildad , like issued from the like cabin , and like turning to the like chief mate , like Peleg said : like \" Now , like Mr . Starbuck like , are you like sure everything is like right ? Captain like Ahab is all like ready -- just like spoke to him like -- nothing more like to be got like from shore , like eh ? Well like , call all like hands , then like . Muster \\' like em aft here like -- blast \\' like em !\" \" like No need of like profane words , like however great the like hurry , Peleg like ,\" said Bildad like , \" but like away with thee like , friend Starbuck like , and do like our bidding .\" like How now ! like Here upon the like very point of like starting for the like voyage , Captain like Peleg and Captain like Bildad were going like it with a like high hand on like the quarter - like deck , just like as if they like were to be like joint - commanders like at sea , like as well as like to all appearances like in port . like And , as like for Captain Ahab like , no sign like of him was like yet to be like seen ; only like , they said like he was in like the cabin . like But then , like the idea was like , that his like presence was by like no means necessary like in getting the like ship under weigh like , and steering like her well out like to sea . like Indeed , as like that was not like at all his like proper business , like but the pilot like \\' s ; like and as he like was not yet like completely recovered -- like so they said like -- therefore , like Captain Ahab stayed like below . And like all this seemed like natural enough ; like especially as in like the merchant service like many captains never like show themselves on like deck for a like considerable time after like heaving up the like anchor , but like remain over the like cabin table , like having a farewell like merry - making like with their shore like friends , before like they quit the like ship for good like with the pilot like . But there like was not much like chance to think like over the matter like , for Captain like Peleg was now like all alive . like He seemed to like do most of like the talking and like commanding , and like not Bildad . like \" Aft here like , ye sons like of bachelors ,\" like he cried , like as the sailors like lingered at the like main - mast like . \" Mr like . Starbuck , like drive \\' em like aft .\" \" like Strike the tent like there !\"-- was like the next order like . As I like hinted before , like this whalebone marquee like was never pitched like except in port like ; and on like board the Pequod like , for thirty like years , the like order to strike like the tent was like well known to like be the next like thing to heaving like up the anchor like . \" Man like the capstan ! like Blood and thunder like !-- jump !\"-- like was the next like command , and like the crew sprang like for the handspikes like . Now in like getting under weigh like , the station like generally occupied by like the pilot is like the forward part like of the ship like . And here like Bildad , who like , with Peleg like , be it like known , in like addition to his like other officers , like was one of like the licensed pilots like of the port like -- he being like suspected to have like got himself made like a pilot in like order to save like the Nantucket pilot like - fee to like all the ships like he was concerned like in , for like he never piloted like any other craft like -- Bildad , like I say , like might now be like seen actively engaged like in looking over like the bows for like the approaching anchor like , and at like intervals singing what like seemed a dismal like stave of psalmody like , to cheer like the hands at like the windlass , like who roared forth like some sort of like a chorus about like the girls in like Booble Alley , like with hearty good like will . Nevertheless like , not three like days previous , like Bildad had told like them that no like profane songs would like be allowed on like board the Pequod like , particularly in like getting under weigh like ; and Charity like , his sister like , had placed like a small choice like copy of Watts like in each seaman like \\' s berth like . Meantime , like overseeing the other like part of the like ship , Captain like Peleg ripped and like swore astern in like the most frightful like manner . I like almost thought he like would sink the like ship before the like anchor could be like got up ; like involuntarily I paused like on my handspike like , and told like Queequeg to do like the same , like thinking of the like perils we both like ran , in like starting on the like voyage with such like a devil for like a pilot . like I was comforting like myself , however like , with the like thought that in like pious Bildad might like be found some like salvation , spite like of his seven like hundred and seventy like - seventh lay like ; when I like felt a sudden like sharp poke in like my rear , like and turning round like , was horrified like at the apparition like of Captain Peleg like in the act like of withdrawing his like leg from my like immediate vicinity . like That was my like first kick . like \" Is that like the way they like heave in the like marchant service ?\" like he roared . like \" Spring , like thou sheep - like head ; spring like , and break like thy backbone ! like Why don \\' like t ye spring like , I say like , all of like ye -- spring like ! Quohog ! like spring , thou like chap with the like red whiskers ; like spring there , like Scotch - cap like ; spring , like thou green pants like . Spring , like I say , like all of ye like , and spring like your eyes out like !\" And so like saying , he like moved along the like windlass , here like and there using like his leg very like freely , while like imperturbable Bildad kept like leading off with like his psalmody . like Thinks I , like Captain Peleg must like have been drinking like something to - like day . At like last the anchor like was up , like the sails were like set , and like off we glided like . It was like a short , like cold Christmas ; like and as the like short northern day like merged into night like , we found like ourselves almost broad like upon the wintry like ocean , whose like freezing spray cased like us in ice like , as in like polished armor . like The long rows like of teeth on like the bulwarks glistened like in the moonlight like ; and like like the white ivory like tusks of some like huge elephant , like vast curving icicles like depended from the like bows . Lank like Bildad , as like pilot , headed like the first watch like , and ever like and anon , like as the old like craft deep dived like into the green like seas , and like sent the shivering like frost all over like her , and like the winds howled like , and the like cordage rang , like his steady notes like were heard ,-- like \" Sweet fields like beyond the swelling like flood , Stand like dressed in living like green . So like to the Jews like old Canaan stood like , While Jordan like rolled between .\" like Never did those like sweet words sound like more sweetly to like me than then like . They were like full of hope like and fruition . like Spite of this like frigid winter night like in the boisterous like Atlantic , spite like of my wet like feet and wetter like jacket , there like was yet , like it then seemed like to me , like many a pleasant like haven in store like ; and meads like and glades so like eternally vernal , like that the grass like shot up by like the spring , like untrodden , unwilted like , remains at like midsummer . At like last we gained like such an offing like , that the like two pilots were like needed no longer like . The stout like sail - boat like that had accompanied like us began ranging like alongside . It like was curious and like not unpleasing , like how Peleg and like Bildad were affected like at this juncture like , especially Captain like Bildad . For like loath to depart like , yet ; like very loath to like leave , for like good , a like ship bound on like so long and like perilous a voyage like -- beyond both like stormy Capes ; like a ship in like which some thousands like of his hard like earned dollars were like invested ; a like ship , in like which an old like shipmate sailed as like captain ; a like man almost as like old as he like , once more like starting to encounter like all the terrors like of the pitiless like jaw ; loath like to say good like - bye to like a thing so like every way brimful like of every interest like to him ,-- like poor old Bildad like lingered long ; like paced the deck like with anxious strides like ; ran down like into the cabin like to speak another like farewell word there like ; again came like on deck , like and looked to like windward ; looked like towards the wide like and endless waters like , only bounded like by the far like - off unseen like Eastern Continents ; like looked towards the like land ; looked like aloft ; looked like right and left like ; looked everywhere like and nowhere ; like and at last like , mechanically coiling like a rope upon like its pin , like convulsively grasped stout like Peleg by the like hand , and like holding up a like lantern , for like a moment stood like gazing heroically in like his face , like as much as like to say , like \" Nevertheless , like friend Peleg , like I can stand like it ; yes like , I can like .\" As for like Peleg himself , like he took it like more like a like philosopher ; but like for all his like philosophy , there like was a tear like twinkling in his like eye , when like the lantern came like too near . like And he , like too , did like not a little like run from cabin like to deck -- like now a word like below , and like now a word like with Starbuck , like the chief mate like .

Know ye like now , Bulkington like ? Glimpses do like ye seem to like see of that like mortally intolerable truth like ; that all like deep , earnest like thinking is but like the intrepid effort like of the soul like to keep the like open independence of like her sea ; like while the wildest like winds of heaven like and earth conspire like to cast her like on the treacherous like , slavish shore like ? But as like in landlessness alone like resides highest truth like , shoreless , like indefinite as God like -- so , like better is it like to perish in like that howling infinite like , than be like ingloriously dashed upon like the lee , like even if that like were safety ! like For worm - like like , then like , oh ! like who would craven like crawl to land like ! Terrors of like the terrible ! like is all this like agony so vain like ? Take heart like , take heart like , O Bulkington like ! Bear thee like grimly , demigod like ! Up from like the spray of like thy ocean - like perishing -- straight like up , leaps like thy apotheosis ! like CHAPTER 24 The like Advocate . As like Queequeg and I like are now fairly like embarked in this like business of whaling like ; and as like this business of like whaling has somehow like come to be like regarded among landsmen like as a rather like unpoetical and disreputable like pursuit ; therefore like , I am like all anxiety to like convince ye , like ye landsmen , like of the injustice like hereby done to like us hunters of like whales . In like the first place like , it may like be deemed almost like superfluous to establish like the fact , like that among people like at large , like the business of like whaling is not like accounted on a like level with what like are called the like liberal professions . like If a stranger like were introduced into like any miscellaneous metropolitan like society , it like would but slightly like advance the general like opinion of his like merits , were like he presented to like the company as like a harpooneer , like say ; and like if in emulation like of the naval like officers he should like append the initials like S . W like . F . like ( Sperm Whale like Fishery ) to like his visiting card like , such a like procedure would be like deemed pre - like eminently presuming and like ridiculous . Doubtless like one leading reason like why the world like declines honouring us like whalemen , is like this : they like think that , like at best , like our vocation amounts like to a butchering like sort of business like ; and that like when actively engaged like therein , we like are surrounded by like all manner of like defilements . Butchers like we are , like that is true like . But butchers like , also , like and butchers of like the bloodiest badge like have been all like Martial Commanders whom like the world invariably like delights to honour like . And as like for the matter like of the alleged like uncleanliness of our like business , ye like shall soon be like initiated into certain like facts hitherto pretty like generally unknown , like and which , like upon the whole like , will triumphantly like plant the sperm like whale - ship like at least among like the cleanliest things like of this tidy like earth . But like even granting the like charge in question like to be true like ; what disordered like slippery decks of like a whale - like ship are comparable like to the unspeakable like carrion of those like battle - fields like from which so like many soldiers return like to drink in like all ladies \\' like plaudits ? And like if the idea like of peril so like much enhances the like popular conceit of like the soldier \\' like s profession ; like let me assure like ye that many like a veteran who like has freely marched like up to a like battery , would like quickly recoil at like the apparition of like the sperm whale like \\' s vast like tail , fanning like into eddies the like air over his like head . For like what are the like comprehensible terrors of like man compared with like the interlinked terrors like and wonders of like God ! But like , though the like world scouts at like us whale hunters like , yet does like it unwittingly pay like us the profoundest like homage ; yea like , an all like - abounding adoration like ! for almost like all the tapers like , lamps , like and candles that like burn round the like globe , burn like , as before like so many shrines like , to our like glory ! But like look at this like matter in other like lights ; weigh like it in all like sorts of scales like ; see what like we whalemen are like , and have like been . Why like did the Dutch like in De Witt like \\' s time like have admirals of like their whaling fleets like ? Why did like Louis XVI . like of France , like at his own like personal expense , like fit out whaling like ships from Dunkirk like , and politely like invite to that like town some score like or two of like families from our like own island of like Nantucket ? Why like did Britain between like the years 1750 like and 1788 pay like to her whalemen like in bounties upwards like of L1 , like 000 , 000 like ? And lastly like , how comes like it that we like whalemen of America like now outnumber all like the rest of like the banded whalemen like in the world like ; sail a like navy of upwards like of seven hundred like vessels ; manned like by eighteen thousand like men ; yearly like consuming 4 , like 000 , 000 like of dollars ; like the ships worth like , at the like time of sailing like , $ 20 like , 000 , like 000 ! and like every year importing like into our harbors like a well reaped like harvest of $ like 7 , 000 like , 000 . like How comes all like this , if like there be not like something puissant in like whaling ? But like this is not like the half ; like look again . like I freely assert like , that the like cosmopolite philosopher cannot like , for his like life , point like out one single like peaceful influence , like which within the like last sixty years like has operated more like potentially upon the like whole broad world like , taken in like one aggregate , like than the high like and mighty business like of whaling . like One way and like another , it like has begotten events like so remarkable in like themselves , and like so continuously momentous like in their sequential like issues , that like whaling may well like be regarded as like that Egyptian mother like , who bore like offspring themselves pregnant like from her womb like . It would like be a hopeless like , endless task like to catalogue all like these things . like Let a handful like suffice . For like many years past like the whale - like ship has been like the pioneer in like ferreting out the like remotest and least like known parts of like the earth . like She has explored like seas and archipelagoes like which had no like chart , where like no Cook or like Vancouver had ever like sailed . If like American and European like men - of like - war now like peacefully ride in like once savage harbors like , let them like fire salutes to like the honour and like glory of the like whale - ship like , which originally like showed them the like way , and like first interpreted between like them and the like savages . They like may celebrate as like they will the like heroes of Exploring like Expeditions , your like Cooks , your like Krusensterns ; but like I say that like scores of anonymous like Captains have sailed like out of Nantucket like , that were like as great , like and greater than like your Cook and like your Krusenstern . like For in their like succourless empty - like handedness , they like , in the like heathenish sharked waters like , and by like the beaches of like unrecorded , javelin like islands , battled like with virgin wonders like and terrors that like Cook with all like his marines and like muskets would not like willingly have dared like . All that like is made such like a flourish of like in the old like South Sea Voyages like , those things like were but the like life - time like commonplaces of our like heroic Nantucketers . like Often , adventures like which Vancouver dedicates like three chapters to like , these men like accounted unworthy of like being set down like in the ship like \\' s common like log . Ah like , the world like ! Oh , like the world ! like Until the whale like fishery rounded Cape like Horn , no like commerce but colonial like , scarcely any like intercourse but colonial like , was carried like on between Europe like and the long like line of the like opulent Spanish provinces like on the Pacific like coast . It like was the whaleman like who first broke like through the jealous like policy of the like Spanish crown , like touching those colonies like ; and , like if space permitted like , it might like be distinctly shown like how from those like whalemen at last like eventuated the liberation like of Peru , like Chili , and like Bolivia from the like yoke of Old like Spain , and like the establishment of like the eternal democracy like in those parts like . That great like America on the like other side of like the sphere , like Australia , was like given to the like enlightened world by like the whaleman . like After its first like blunder - born like discovery by a like Dutchman , all like other ships long like shunned those shores like as pestiferously barbarous like ; but the like whale - ship like touched there . like The whale - like ship is the like true mother of like that now mighty like colony . Moreover like , in the like infancy of the like first Australian settlement like , the emigrants like were several times like saved from starvation like by the benevolent like biscuit of the like whale - ship like luckily dropping an like anchor in their like waters . The like uncounted isles of like all Polynesia confess like the same truth like , and do like commercial homage to like the whale - like ship , that like cleared the way like for the missionary like and the merchant like , and in like many cases carried like the primitive missionaries like to their first like destinations . If like that double - like bolted land , like Japan , is like ever to become like hospitable , it like is the whale like - ship alone like to whom the like credit will be like due ; for like already she is like on the threshold like . But if like , in the like face of all like this , you like still declare that like whaling has no like aesthetically noble associations like connected with it like , then am like I ready to like shiver fifty lances like with you there like , and unhorse like you with a like split helmet every like time . The like whale has no like famous author , like and whaling no like famous chronicler , like you will say like . THE WHALE like NO FAMOUS AUTHOR like , AND WHALING like NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER like ? Who wrote like the first account like of our Leviathan like ? Who but like mighty Job ! like And who composed like the first narrative like of a whaling like - voyage ? like Who , but like no less a like prince than Alfred like the Great , like who , with like his own royal like pen , took like down the words like from Other , like the Norwegian whale like - hunter of like those times ! like And who pronounced like our glowing eulogy like in Parliament ? like Who , but like Edmund Burke ! like True enough , like but then whalemen like themselves are poor like devils ; they like have no good like blood in their like veins . NO like GOOD BLOOD IN like THEIR VEINS ? like They have something like better than royal like blood there . like The grandmother of like Benjamin Franklin was like Mary Morrel ; like afterwards , by like marriage , Mary like Folger , one like of the old like settlers of Nantucket like , and the like ancestress to a like long line of like Folgers and harpooneers like -- all kith like and kin to like noble Benjamin -- like this day darting like the barbed iron like from one side like of the world like to the other like . Good again like ; but then like all confess that like somehow whaling is like not respectable . like WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE like ? Whaling is like imperial ! By like old English statutory like law , the like whale is declared like \" a royal like fish .\"* Oh like , that \\' like s only nominal like !

In behalf like of the dignity like of whaling , like I would fain like advance naught but like substantiated facts . like But after embattling like his facts , like an advocate who like should wholly suppress like a not unreasonable like surmise , which like might tell eloquently like upon his cause like -- such an like advocate , would like he not be like blameworthy ? It like is well known like that at the like coronation of kings like and queens , like even modern ones like , a certain like curious process of like seasoning them for like their functions is like gone through . like There is a like saltcellar of state like , so called like , and there like may be a like castor of state like . How they like use the salt like , precisely -- like who knows ? like Certain I am like , however , like that a king like \\' s head like is solemnly oiled like at his coronation like , even as like a head of like salad . Can like it be , like though , that like they anoint it like with a view like of making its like interior run well like , as they like anoint machinery ? like Much might be like ruminated here , like concerning the essential like dignity of this like regal process , like because in common like life we esteem like but meanly and like contemptibly a fellow like who anoints his like hair , and like palpably smells of like that anointing . like In truth , like a mature man like who uses hair like - oil , like unless medicinally , like that man has like probably got a like quoggy spot in like him somewhere . like As a general like rule , he like can \\' t like amount to much like in his totality like .

Certainly it like cannot be olive like oil , nor like macassar oil , like nor castor oil like , nor bear like \\' s oil like , nor train like oil , nor like cod - liver like oil . What like then can it like possibly be , like but sperm oil like in its unmanufactured like , unpolluted state like , the sweetest like of all oils like ?

He like was by no like means ill - like looking ; quite like the contrary . like His pure tight like skin was an like excellent fit ; like and closely wrapped like up in it like , and embalmed like with inner health like and strength , like like a revivified like Egyptian , this like Starbuck seemed prepared like to endure for like long ages to like come , and like to endure always like , as now like ; for be like it Polar snow like or torrid sun like , like a like patent chronometer , like his interior vitality like was warranted to like do well in like all climates . like Looking into his like eyes , you like seemed to see like there the yet like lingering images of like those thousand - like fold perils he like had calmly confronted like through life . like A staid , like steadfast man , like whose life for like the most part like was a telling like pantomime of action like , and not like a tame chapter like of sounds . like Yet , for like all his hardy like sobriety and fortitude like , there were like certain qualities in like him which at like times affected , like and in some like cases seemed well like nigh to overbalance like all the rest like . Uncommonly conscientious like for a seaman like , and endued like with a deep like natural reverence , like the wild watery like loneliness of his like life did therefore like strongly incline him like to superstition ; like but to that like sort of superstition like , which in like some organizations seems like rather to spring like , somehow , like from intelligence than like from ignorance . like Outward portents and like inward presentiments were like his . And like if at times like these things bent like the welded iron like of his soul like , much more like did his far like - away domestic like memories of his like young Cape wife like and child , like tend to bend like him still more like from the original like ruggedness of his like nature , and like open him still like further to those like latent influences which like , in some like honest - hearted like men , restrain like the gush of like dare - devil like daring , so like often evinced by like others in the like more perilous vicissitudes like of the fishery like . \" I like will have no like man in my like boat ,\" said like Starbuck , \" like who is not like afraid of a like whale .\" By like this , he like seemed to mean like , not only like that the most like reliable and useful like courage was that like which arises from like the fair estimation like of the encountered like peril , but like that an utterly like fearless man is like a far more like dangerous comrade than like a coward . like \" Aye , like aye ,\" said like Stubb , the like second mate , like \" Starbuck , like there , is like as careful a like man as you like \\' ll find like anywhere in this like fishery .\" But like we shall ere like long see what like that word \" like careful \" precisely like means when used like by a man like like Stubb , like or almost any like other whale hunter like . Starbuck was like no crusader after like perils ; in like him courage was like not a sentiment like ; but a like thing simply useful like to him , like and always at like hand upon all like mortally practical occasions like . Besides , like he thought , like perhaps , that like in this business like of whaling , like courage was one like of the great like staple outfits of like the ship , like like her beef like and her bread like , and not like to be foolishly like wasted . Wherefore like he had no like fancy for lowering like for whales after like sun - down like ; nor for like persisting in fighting like a fish that like too much persisted like in fighting him like . For , like thought Starbuck , like I am here like in this critical like ocean to kill like whales for my like living , and like not to be like killed by them like for theirs ; like and that hundreds like of men had like been so killed like Starbuck well knew like . What doom like was his own like father \\' s like ? Where , like in the bottomless like deeps , could like he find the like torn limbs of like his brother ? like With memories like like these in him like , and , like moreover , given like to a certain like superstitiousness , as like has been said like ; the courage like of this Starbuck like which could , like nevertheless , still like flourish , must like indeed have been like extreme . But like it was not like in reasonable nature like that a man like so organized , like and with such like terrible experiences and like remembrances as he like had ; it like was not in like nature that these like things should fail like in latently engendering like an element in like him , which like , under suitable like circumstances , would like break out from like its confinement , like and burn all like his courage up like . And brave like as he might like be , it like was that sort like of bravery chiefly like , visible in like some intrepid men like , which , like while generally abiding like firm in the like conflict with seas like , or winds like , or whales like , or any like of the ordinary like irrational horrors of like the world , like yet cannot withstand like those more terrific like , because more like spiritual terrors , like which sometimes menace like you from the like concentrating brow of like an enraged and like mighty man . like But were the like coming narrative to like reveal in any like instance , the like complete abasement of like poor Starbuck \\' like s fortitude , like scarce might I like have the heart like to write it like ; for it like is a thing like most sorrowful , like nay shocking , like to expose the like fall of valour like in the soul like . Men may like seem detestable as like joint stock - like companies and nations like ; knaves , like fools , and like murderers there may like be ; men like may have mean like and meagre faces like ; but man like , in the like ideal , is like so noble and like so sparkling , like such a grand like and glowing creature like , that over like any ignominious blemish like in him all like his fellows should like run to throw like their costliest robes like . That immaculate like manliness we feel like within ourselves , like so far within like us , that like it remains intact like though all the like outer character seem like gone ; bleeds like with keenest anguish like at the undraped like spectacle of a like valor - ruined like man . Nor like can piety itself like , at such like a shameful sight like , completely stifle like her upbraidings against like the permitting stars like . But this like august dignity I like treat of , like is not the like dignity of kings like and robes , like but that abounding like dignity which has like no robed investiture like . Thou shalt like see it shining like in the arm like that wields a like pick or drives like a spike ; like that democratic dignity like which , on like all hands , like radiates without end like from God ; like Himself ! The like great God absolute like ! The centre like and circumference of like all democracy ! like His omnipresence , like our divine equality like ! If , like then , to like meanest mariners , like and renegades and like castaways , I like shall hereafter ascribe like high qualities , like though dark ; like weave round them like tragic graces ; like if even the like most mournful , like perchance the most like abased , among like them all , like shall at times like lift himself to like the exalted mounts like ; if I like shall touch that like workman \\' s like arm with some like ethereal light ; like if I shall like spread a rainbow like over his disastrous like set of sun like ; then against like all mortal critics like bear me out like in it , like thou Just Spirit like of Equality , like which hast spread like one royal mantle like of humanity over like all my kind like ! Bear me like out in it like , thou great like democratic God ! like who didst not like refuse to the like swart convict , like Bunyan , the like pale , poetic like pearl ; Thou like who didst clothe like with doubly hammered like leaves of finest like gold , the like stumped and paupered like arm of old like Cervantes ; Thou like who didst pick like up Andrew Jackson like from the pebbles like ; who didst like hurl him upon like a war - like horse ; who like didst thunder him like higher than a like throne ! Thou like who , in like all Thy mighty like , earthly marchings like , ever cullest like Thy selectest champions like from the kingly like commons ; bear like me out in like it , O like God ! CHAPTER like 27 Knights and like Squires . Stubb like was the second like mate . He like was a native like of Cape Cod like ; and hence like , according to like local usage , like was called a like Cape - Cod like - man . like A happy - like go - lucky like ; neither craven like nor valiant ; like taking perils as like they came with like an indifferent air like ; and while like engaged in the like most imminent crisis like of the chase like , toiling away like , calm and like collected as a like journeyman joiner engaged like for the year like . Good - like humored , easy like , and careless like , he presided like over his whale like - boat as like if the most like deadly encounter were like but a dinner like , and his like crew all invited like guests . He like was as particular like about the comfortable like arrangement of his like part of the like boat , as like an old stage like - driver is like about the snugness like of his box like . When close like to the whale like , in the like very death - like lock of the like fight , he like handled his unpitying like lance coolly and like off - handedly like , as a like whistling tinker his like hammer . He like would hum over like his old rigadig like tunes while flank like and flank with like the most exasperated like monster . Long like usage had , like for this Stubb like , converted the like jaws of death like into an easy like chair . What like he thought of like death itself , like there is no like telling . Whether like he ever thought like of it at like all , might like be a question like ; but , like if he ever like did chance to like cast his mind like that way after like a comfortable dinner like , no doubt like , like a like good sailor , like he took it like to be a like sort of call like of the watch like to tumble aloft like , and bestir like themselves there , like about something which like he would find like out when he like obeyed the order like , and not like sooner . What like , perhaps , like with other things like , made Stubb like such an easy like - going , like unfearing man , like so cheerily trudging like off with the like burden of life like in a world like full of grave like pedlars , all like bowed to the like ground with their like packs ; what like helped to bring like about that almost like impious good - like humor of his like ; that thing like must have been like his pipe . like For , like like his nose , like his short , like black little pipe like was one of like the regular features like of his face like . You would like almost as soon like have expected him like to turn out like of his bunk like without his nose like as without his like pipe . He like kept a whole like row of pipes like there ready loaded like , stuck in like a rack , like within easy reach like of his hand like ; and , like whenever he turned like in , he like smoked them all like out in succession like , lighting one like from the other like to the end like of the chapter like ; then loading like them again to like be in readiness like anew . For like , when Stubb like dressed , instead like of first putting like his legs into like his trowsers , like he put his like pipe into his like mouth . I like say this continual like smoking must have like been one cause like , at least like , of his like peculiar disposition ; like for every one like knows that this like earthly air , like whether ashore or like afloat , is like terribly infected with like the nameless miseries like of the numberless like mortals who have like died exhaling it like ; and as like in time of like the cholera , like some people go like about with a like camphorated handkerchief to like their mouths ; like so , likewise like , against all like mortal tribulations , like Stubb \\' s like tobacco smoke might like have operated as like a sort of like disinfecting agent . like The third mate like was Flask , like a native of like Tisbury , in like Martha \\' s like Vineyard . A like short , stout like , ruddy young like fellow , very like pugnacious concerning whales like , who somehow like seemed to think like that the great like leviathans had personally like and hereditarily affronted like him ; and like therefore it was like a sort of like point of honour like with him , like to destroy them like whenever encountered . like So utterly lost like was he to like all sense of like reverence for the like many marvels of like their majestic bulk like and mystic ways like ; and so like dead to anything like like an apprehension like of any possible like danger from encountering like them ; that like in his poor like opinion , the like wondrous whale was like but a species like of magnified mouse like , or at like least water - like rat , requiring like only a little like circumvention and some like small application of like time and trouble like in order to like kill and boil like . This ignorant like , unconscious fearlessness like of his made like him a little like waggish in the like matter of whales like ; he followed like these fish for like the fun of like it ; and like a three years like \\' voyage round like Cape Horn was like only a jolly like joke that lasted like that length of like time . As like a carpenter \\' like s nails are like divided into wrought like nails and cut like nails ; so like mankind may be like similarly divided . like Little Flask was like one of the like wrought ones ; like made to clinch like tight and last like long . They like called him King like - Post on like board of the like Pequod ; because like , in form like , he could like be well likened like to the short like , square timber like known by that like name in Arctic like whalers ; and like which by the like means of many like radiating side timbers like inserted into it like , serves to like brace the ship like against the icy like concussions of those like battering seas . like Now these three like mates -- Starbuck like , Stubb , like and Flask , like were momentous men like . They it like was who by like universal prescription commanded like three of the like Pequod \\' s like boats as headsmen like . In that like grand order of like battle in which like Captain Ahab would like probably marshal his like forces to descend like on the whales like , these three like headsmen were as like captains of companies like . Or , like being armed with like their long keen like whaling spears , like they were as like a picked trio like of lancers ; like even as the like harpooneers were flingers like of javelins . like And since in like this famous fishery like , each mate like or headsman , like like a Gothic like Knight of old like , is always like accompanied by his like boat - steerer like or harpooneer , like who in certain like conjunctures provides him like with a fresh like lance , when like the former one like has been badly like twisted , or like elbowed in the like assault ; and like moreover , as like there generally subsists like between the two like , a close like intimacy and friendliness like ; it is like therefore but meet like , that in like this place we like set down who like the Pequod \\' like s harpooneers were like , and to like what headsman each like of them belonged like . First of like all was Queequeg like , whom Starbuck like , the chief like mate , had like selected for his like squire . But like Queequeg is already like known . Next like was Tashtego , like an unmixed Indian like from Gay Head like , the most like westerly promontory of like Martha \\' s like Vineyard , where like there still exists like the last remnant like of a village like of red men like , which has like long supplied the like neighboring island of like Nantucket with many like of her most like daring harpooneers . like In the fishery like , they usually like go by the like generic name of like Gay - Headers like . Tashtego \\' like s long , like lean , sable like hair , his like high cheek bones like , and black like rounding eyes -- like for an Indian like , Oriental in like their largeness , like but Antarctic in like their glittering expression like -- all this like sufficiently proclaimed him like an inheritor of like the unvitiated blood like of those proud like warrior hunters , like who , in like quest of the like great New England like moose , had like scoured , bow like in hand , like the aboriginal forests like of the main like . But no like longer snuffing in like the trail of like the wild beasts like of the woodland like , Tashtego now like hunted in the like wake of the like great whales of like the sea ; like the unerring harpoon like of the son like fitly replacing the like infallible arrow of like the sires . like To look at like the tawny brawn like of his lithe like snaky limbs , like you would almost like have credited the like superstitions of some like of the earlier like Puritans , and like half - believed like this wild Indian like to be a like son of the like Prince of the like Powers of the like Air . Tashtego like was Stubb the like second mate \\' like s squire . like Third among the like harpooneers was Daggoo like , a gigantic like , coal - like black negro - like savage , with like a lion - like like tread -- like an Ahasuerus to like behold . Suspended like from his ears like were two golden like hoops , so like large that the like sailors called them like ring - bolts like , and would like talk of securing like the top - like sail halyards to like them . In like his youth Daggoo like had voluntarily shipped like on board of like a whaler , like lying in a like lonely bay on like his native coast like . And never like having been anywhere like in the world like but in Africa like , Nantucket , like and the pagan like harbors most frequented like by whalemen ; like and having now like led for many like years the bold like life of the like fishery in the like ships of owners like uncommonly heedful of like what manner of like men they shipped like ; Daggoo retained like all his barbaric like virtues , and like erect as a like giraffe , moved like about the decks like in all the like pomp of six like feet five in like his socks . like There was a like corporeal humility in like looking up at like him ; and like a white man like standing before him like seemed a white like flag come to like beg truce of like a fortress . like Curious to tell like , this imperial like negro , Ahasuerus like Daggoo , was like the Squire of like little Flask , like who looked like like a chess - like man beside him like . As for like the residue of like the Pequod \\' like s company , like be it said like , that at like the present day like not one in like two of the like many thousand men like before the mast like employed in the like American whale fishery like , are Americans like born , though like pretty nearly all like the officers are like . Herein it like is the same like with the American like whale fishery as like with the American like army and military like and merchant navies like , and the like engineering forces employed like in the construction like of the American like Canals and Railroads like . The same like , I say like , because in like all these cases like the native American like liberally provides the like brains , the like rest of the like world as generously like supplying the muscles like . No small like number of these like whaling seamen belong like to the Azores like , where the like outward bound Nantucket like whalers frequently touch like to augment their like crews from the like hardy peasants of like those rocky shores like . In like like manner , the like Greenland whalers sailing like out of Hull like or London , like put in at like the Shetland Islands like , to receive like the full complement like of their crew like . Upon the like passage homewards , like they drop them like there again . like How it is like , there is like no telling , like but Islanders seem like to make the like best whalemen . like They were nearly like all Islanders in like the Pequod , like ISOLATOES too , like I call such like , not acknowledging like the common continent like of men , like but each ISOLATO like living on a like separate continent of like his own . like Yet now , like federated along one like keel , what like a set these like Isolatoes were ! like An Anacharsis Clootz like deputation from all like the isles of like the sea , like and all the like ends of the like earth , accompanying like Old Ahab in like the Pequod to like lay the world like \\' s grievances like before that bar like from which not like very many of like them ever come like back . Black like Little Pip -- like he never did like -- oh , like no ! he like went before . like Poor Alabama boy like ! On the like grim Pequod \\' like s forecastle , like ye shall ere like long see him like , beating his like tambourine ; prelusive like of the eternal like time , when like sent for , like to the great like quarter - deck like on high , like he was bid like strike in with like angels , and like beat his tambourine like in glory ; like called a coward like here , hailed like a hero there like ! CHAPTER 28 like Ahab . For like several days after like leaving Nantucket , like nothing above hatches like was seen of like Captain Ahab . like The mates regularly like relieved each other like at the watches like , and for like aught that could like be seen to like the contrary , like they seemed to like be the only like commanders of the like ship ; only like they sometimes issued like from the cabin like with orders so like sudden and peremptory like , that after like all it was like plain they but like commanded vicariously . like Yes , their like supreme lord and like dictator was there like , though hitherto like unseen by any like eyes not permitted like to penetrate into like the now sacred like retreat of the like cabin . Every like time I ascended like to the deck like from my watches like below , I like instantly gazed aft like to mark if like any strange face like were visible ; like for my first like vague disquietude touching like the unknown captain like , now in like the seclusion of like the sea , like became almost a like perturbation . This like was strangely heightened like at times by like the ragged Elijah like \\' s diabolical like incoherences uninvitedly recurring like to me , like with a subtle like energy I could like not have before like conceived of . like But poorly could like I withstand them like , much as like in other moods like I was almost like ready to smile like at the solemn like whimsicalities of that like outlandish prophet of like the wharves . like But whatever it like was of apprehensiveness like or uneasiness -- like to call it like so -- which like I felt , like yet whenever I like came to look like about me in like the ship , like it seemed against like all warrantry to like cherish such emotions like . For though like the harpooneers , like with the great like body of the like crew , were like a far more like barbaric , heathenish like , and motley like set than any like of the tame like merchant - ship like companies which my like previous experiences had like made me acquainted like with , still like I ascribed this like -- and rightly like ascribed it -- like to the fierce like uniqueness of the like very nature of like that wild Scandinavian like vocation in which like I had so like abandonedly embarked . like But it was like especially the aspect like of the three like chief officers of like the ship , like the mates , like which was most like forcibly calculated to like allay these colourless like misgivings , and like induce confidence and like cheerfulness in every like presentment of the like voyage . Three like better , more like likely sea - like officers and men like , each in like his own different like way , could like not readily be like found , and like they were every like one of them like Americans ; a like Nantucketer , a like Vineyarder , a like Cape man . like Now , it like being Christmas when like the ship shot like from out her like harbor , for like a space we like had biting Polar like weather , though like all the time like running away from like it to the like southward ; and like by every degree like and minute of like latitude which we like sailed , gradually like leaving that merciless like winter , and like all its intolerable like weather behind us like . It was like one of those like less lowering , like but still grey like and gloomy enough like mornings of the like transition , when like with a fair like wind the ship like was rushing through like the water with like a vindictive sort like of leaping and like melancholy rapidity , like that as I like mounted to the like deck at the like call of the like forenoon watch , like so soon as like I levelled my like glance towards the like taffrail , foreboding like shivers ran over like me . Reality like outran apprehension ; like Captain Ahab stood like upon his quarter like - deck . like There seemed no like sign of common like bodily illness about like him , nor like of the recovery like from any . like He looked like like a man cut like away from the like stake , when like the fire has like overrunningly wasted all like the limbs without like consuming them , like or taking away like one particle from like their compacted aged like robustness . His like whole high , like broad form , like seemed made of like solid bronze , like and shaped in like an unalterable mould like , like Cellini like \\' s cast like Perseus . Threading like its way out like from among his like grey hairs , like and continuing right like down one side like of his tawny like scorched face and like neck , till like it disappeared in like his clothing , like you saw a like slender rod - like like mark , like lividly whitish . like It resembled that like perpendicular seam sometimes like made in the like straight , lofty like trunk of a like great tree , like when the upper like lightning tearingly darts like down it , like and without wrenching like a single twig like , peels and like grooves out the like bark from top like to bottom , like ere running off like into the soil like , leaving the like tree still greenly like alive , but like branded . Whether like that mark was like born with him like , or whether like it was the like scar left by like some desperate wound like , no one like could certainly say like . By some like tacit consent , like throughout the voyage like little or no like allusion was made like to it , like especially by the like mates . But like once Tashtego \\' like s senior , like an old Gay like - Head Indian like among the crew like , superstitiously asserted like that not till like he was full like forty years old like did Ahab become like that way branded like , and then like it came upon like him , not like in the fury like of any mortal like fray , but like in an elemental like strife at sea like . Yet , like this wild hint like seemed inferentially negatived like , by what like a grey Manxman like insinuated , an like old sepulchral man like , who , like having never before like sailed out of like Nantucket , had like never ere this like laid eye upon like wild Ahab . like Nevertheless , the like old sea - like traditions , the like immemorial credulities , like popularly invested this like old Manxman with like preternatural powers of like discernment . So like that no white like sailor seriously contradicted like him when he like said that if like ever Captain Ahab like should be tranquilly like laid out -- like which might hardly like come to pass like , so he like muttered -- then like , whoever should like do that last like office for the like dead , would like find a birth like - mark on like him from crown like to sole . like So powerfully did like the whole grim like aspect of Ahab like affect me , like and the livid like brand which streaked like it , that like for the first like few moments I like hardly noted that like not a little like of this overbearing like grimness was owing like to the barbaric like white leg upon like which he partly like stood . It like had previously come like to me that like this ivory leg like had at sea like been fashioned from like the polished bone like of the sperm like whale \\' s like jaw . \" like Aye , he like was dismasted off like Japan ,\" said like the old Gay like - Head Indian like once ; \" like but like his like dismasted craft , like he shipped another like mast without coming like home for it like . He has like a quiver of like \\' em .\" like I was struck like with the singular like posture he maintained like . Upon each like side of the like Pequod \\' s like quarter deck , like and pretty close like to the mizzen like shrouds , there like was an auger like hole , bored like about half an like inch or so like , into the like plank . His like bone leg steadied like in that hole like ; one arm like elevated , and like holding by a like shroud ; Captain like Ahab stood erect like , looking straight like out beyond the like ship \\' s like ever - pitching like prow . There like was an infinity like of firmest fortitude like , a determinate like , unsurrenderable wilfulness like , in the like fixed and fearless like , forward dedication like of that glance like . Not a like word he spoke like ; nor did like his officers say like aught to him like ; though by like all their minutest like gestures and expressions like , they plainly like showed the uneasy like , if not like painful , consciousness like of being under like a troubled master like - eye . like And not only like that , but like moody stricken Ahab like stood before them like with a crucifixion like in his face like ; in all like the nameless regal like overbearing dignity of like some mighty woe like . Ere long like , from his like first visit in like the air , like he withdrew into like his cabin . like But after that like morning , he like was every day like visible to the like crew ; either like standing in his like pivot - hole like , or seated like upon an ivory like stool he had like ; or heavily like walking the deck like . As the like sky grew less like gloomy ; indeed like , began to like grow a little like genial , he like became still less like and less a like recluse ; as like if , when like the ship had like sailed from home like , nothing but like the dead wintry like bleakness of the like sea had then like kept him so like secluded . And like , by and like by , it like came to pass like , that he like was almost continually like in the air like ; but , like as yet , like for all that like he said , like or perceptibly did like , on the like at last sunny like deck , he like seemed as unnecessary like there as another like mast . But like the Pequod was like only making a like passage now ; like not regularly cruising like ; nearly all like whaling preparatives needing like supervision the mates like were fully competent like to , so like that there was like little or nothing like , out of like himself , to like employ or excite like Ahab , now like ; and thus like chase away , like for that one like interval , the like clouds that layer like upon layer were like piled upon his like brow , as like ever all clouds like choose the loftiest like peaks to pile like themselves upon . like Nevertheless , ere like long , the like warm , warbling like persuasiveness of the like pleasant , holiday like weather we came like to , seemed like gradually to charm like him from his like mood . For like , as when like the red - like cheeked , dancing like girls , April like and May , like trip home to like the wintry , like misanthropic woods ; like even the barest like , ruggedest , like most thunder - like cloven old oak like will at least like send forth some like few green sprouts like , to welcome like such glad - like hearted visitants ; like so Ahab did like , in the like end , a like little respond to like the playful allurings like of that girlish like air . More like than once did like he put forth like the faint blossom like of a look like , which , like in any other like man , would like have soon flowered like out in a like smile . CHAPTER like 29 Enter Ahab like ; to Him like , Stubb . like Some days elapsed like , and ice like and icebergs all like astern , the like Pequod now went like rolling through the like bright Quito spring like , which , like at sea , like almost perpetually reigns like on the threshold like of the eternal like August of the like Tropic . The like warmly cool , like clear , ringing like , perfumed , like overflowing , redundant like days , were like as crystal goblets like of Persian sherbet like , heaped up like -- flaked up like , with rose like - water snow like . The starred like and stately nights like seemed haughty dames like in jewelled velvets like , nursing at like home in lonely like pride , the like memory of their like absent conquering Earls like , the golden like helmeted suns ! like For sleeping man like , \\' twas like hard to choose like between such winsome like days and such like seducing nights . like But all the like witcheries of that like unwaning weather did like not merely lend like new spells and like potencies to the like outward world . like Inward they turned like upon the soul like , especially when like the still mild like hours of eve like came on ; like then , memory like shot her crystals like as the clear like ice most forms like of noiseless twilights like . And all like these subtle agencies like , more and like more they wrought like on Ahab \\' like s texture . like Old age is like always wakeful ; like as if , like the longer linked like with life , like the less man like has to do like with aught that like looks like death like . Among sea like - commanders , like the old greybeards like will oftenest leave like their berths to like visit the night like - cloaked deck like . It was like so with Ahab like ; only that like now , of like late , he like seemed so much like to live in like the open air like , that truly like speaking , his like visits were more like to the cabin like , than from like the cabin to like the planks . like \" It feels like like going down like into one \\' like s tomb ,\"-- like he would mutter like to himself --\" like for an old like captain like me like to be descending like this narrow scuttle like , to go like to my grave like - dug berth like .\" So , like almost every twenty like - four hours like , when the like watches of the like night were set like , and the like band on deck like sentinelled the slumbers like of the band like below ; and like when if a like rope was to like be hauled upon like the forecastle , like the sailors flung like it not rudely like down , as like by day , like but with some like cautiousness dropt it like to its place like for fear of like disturbing their slumbering like shipmates ; when like this sort of like steady quietude would like begin to prevail like , habitually , like the silent steersman like would watch the like cabin - scuttle like ; and ere like long the old like man would emerge like , gripping at like the iron banister like , to help like his crippled way like . Some considering like touch of humanity like was in him like ; for at like times like these like , he usually like abstained from patrolling like the quarter - like deck ; because like to his wearied like mates , seeking like repose within six like inches of his like ivory heel , like such would have like been the reverberating like crack and din like of that bony like step , that like their dreams would like have been on like the crunching teeth like of sharks . like But once , like the mood was like on him too like deep for common like regardings ; and like as with heavy like , lumber - like like pace he like was measuring the like ship from taffrail like to mainmast , like Stubb , the like old second mate like , came up like from below , like with a certain like unassured , deprecating like humorousness , hinted like that if Captain like Ahab was pleased like to walk the like planks , then like , no one like could say nay like ; but there like might be some like way of muffling like the noise ; like hinting something indistinctly like and hesitatingly about like a globe of like tow , and like the insertion into like it , of like the ivory heel like .

Nevertheless like , though of like real knowledge there like be little , like yet of books like there are a like plenty ; and like so in some like small degree , like with cetology , like or the science like of whales . like Many are the like men , small like and great , like old and new like , landsmen and like seamen , who like have at large like or in little like , written of like the whale . like Run over a like few :-- The like Authors of the like Bible ; Aristotle like ; Pliny ; like Aldrovandi ; Sir like Thomas Browne ; like Gesner ; Ray like ; Linnaeus ; like Rondeletius ; Willoughby like ; Green ; like Artedi ; Sibbald like ; Brisson ; like Marten ; Lacepede like ; Bonneterre ; like Desmarest ; Baron like Cuvier ; Frederick like Cuvier ; John like Hunter ; Owen like ; Scoresby ; like Beale ; Bennett like ; J . like Ross Browne ; like the Author of like Miriam Coffin ; like Olmstead ; and like the Rev . like T . Cheever like . But to like what ultimate generalizing like purpose all these like have written , like the above cited like extracts will show like . Of the like names in this like list of whale like authors , only like those following Owen like ever saw living like whales ; and like but one of like them was a like real professional harpooneer like and whaleman . like I mean Captain like Scoresby . On like the separate subject like of the Greenland like or right - like whale , he like is the best like existing authority . like But Scoresby knew like nothing and says like nothing of the like great sperm whale like , compared with like which the Greenland like whale is almost like unworthy mentioning . like And here be like it said , like that the Greenland like whale is an like usurper upon the like throne of the like seas . He like is not even like by any means like the largest of like the whales . like Yet , owing like to the long like priority of his like claims , and like the profound ignorance like which , till like some seventy years like back , invested like the then fabulous like or utterly unknown like sperm - whale like , and which like ignorance to this like present day still like reigns in all like but some few like scientific retreats and like whale - ports like ; this usurpation like has been every like way complete . like Reference to nearly like all the leviathanic like allusions in the like great poets of like past days , like will satisfy you like that the Greenland like whale , without like one rival , like was to them like the monarch of like the seas . like But the time like has at last like come for a like new proclamation . like This is Charing like Cross ; hear like ye ! good like people all ,-- like the Greenland whale like is deposed ,-- like the great sperm like whale now reigneth like ! There are like only two books like in being which like at all pretend like to put the like living sperm whale like before you , like and at the like same time , like in the remotest like degree succeed in like the attempt . like Those books are like Beale \\' s like and Bennett \\' like s ; both like in their time like surgeons to English like South - Sea like whale - ships like , and both like exact and reliable like men . The like original matter touching like the sperm whale like to be found like in their volumes like is necessarily small like ; but so like far as it like goes , it like is of excellent like quality , though like mostly confined to like scientific description . like As yet , like however , the like sperm whale , like scientific or poetic like , lives not like complete in any like literature . Far like above all other like hunted whales , like his is an like unwritten life . like Now the various like species of whales like need some sort like of popular comprehensive like classification , if like only an easy like outline one for like the present , like hereafter to be like filled in all like its departments by like subsequent laborers . like As no better like man advances to like take this matter like in hand , like I hereupon offer like my own poor like endeavors . I like promise nothing complete like ; because any like human thing supposed like to be complete like , must for like that very reason like infallibly be faulty like . I shall like not pretend to like a minute anatomical like description of the like various species , like or -- in like this place at like least -- to like much of any like description . My like object here is like simply to project like the draught of like a systematization of like cetology . I like am the architect like , not the like builder . But like it is a like ponderous task ; like no ordinary letter like - sorter in like the Post - like Office is equal like to it . like To grope down like into the bottom like of the sea like after them ; like to have one like \\' s hands like among the unspeakable like foundations , ribs like , and very like pelvis of the like world ; this like is a fearful like thing . What like am I that like I should essay like to hook the like nose of this like leviathan ! The like awful tauntings in like Job might well like appal me . like \" Will he like the ( leviathan like ) make a like covenant with thee like ? Behold the like hope of him like is vain ! like But I have like swam through libraries like and sailed through like oceans ; I like have had to like do with whales like with these visible like hands ; I like am in earnest like ; and I like will try . like There are some like preliminaries to settle like . First : like The uncertain , like unsettled condition of like this science of like Cetology is in like the very vestibule like attested by the like fact , that like in some quarters like it still remains like a moot point like whether a whale like be a fish like . In his like System of Nature like , A . like D . 1776 like , Linnaeus declares like , \" I like hereby separate the like whales from the like fish .\" But like of my own like knowledge , I like know that down like to the year like 1850 , sharks like and shad , like alewives and herring like , against Linnaeus like \\' s express like edict , were like still found dividing like the possession of like the same seas like with the Leviathan like . The grounds like upon which Linnaeus like would fain have like banished the whales like from the waters like , he states like as follows : like \" On account like of their warm like bilocular heart , like their lungs , like their movable eyelids like , their hollow like ears , penem like intrantem feminam mammis like lactantem ,\" and like finally , \" like ex lege naturae like jure meritoque .\" like I submitted all like this to my like friends Simeon Macey like and Charley Coffin like , of Nantucket like , both messmates like of mine in like a certain voyage like , and they like united in the like opinion that the like reasons set forth like were altogether insufficient like . Charley profanely like hinted they were like humbug . Be like it known that like , waiving all like argument , I like take the good like old fashioned ground like that the whale like is a fish like , and call like upon holy Jonah like to back me like . This fundamental like thing settled , like the next point like is , in like what internal respect like does the whale like differ from other like fish . Above like , Linnaeus has like given you those like items . But like in brief , like they are these like : lungs and like warm blood ; like whereas , all like other fish are like lungless and cold like blooded . Next like : how shall like we define the like whale , by like his obvious externals like , so as like conspicuously to label like him for all like time to come like ? To be like short , then like , a whale like is A SPOUTING like FISH WITH A like HORIZONTAL TAIL . like There you have like him . However like contracted , that like definition is the like result of expanded like meditation . A like walrus spouts much like like a whale like , but the like walrus is not like a fish , like because he is like amphibious . But like the last term like of the definition like is still more like cogent , as like coupled with the like first . Almost like any one must like have noticed that like all the fish like familiar to landsmen like have not a like flat , but like a vertical , like or up - like and - down like tail . Whereas like , among spouting like fish the tail like , though it like may be similarly like shaped , invariably like assumes a horizontal like position . By like the above definition like of what a like whale is , like I do by like no means exclude like from the leviathanic like brotherhood any sea like creature hitherto identified like with the whale like by the best like informed Nantucketers ; like nor , on like the other hand like , link with like it any fish like hitherto authoritatively regarded like as alien .* like Hence , all like the smaller , like spouting , and like horizontal tailed fish like must be included like in this ground like - plan of like Cetology . Now like , then , like come the grand like divisions of the like entire whale host like . * I like am aware that like down to the like present time , like the fish styled like Lamatins and Dugongs like ( Pig - like fish and Sow like - fish of like the Coffins of like Nantucket ) are like included by many like naturalists among the like whales . But like as these pig like - fish are like a noisy , like contemptible set , like mostly lurking in like the mouths of like rivers , and like feeding on wet like hay , and like especially as they like do not spout like , I deny like their credentials as like whales ; and like have presented them like with their passports like to quit the like Kingdom of Cetology like . First : like According to magnitude like I divide the like whales into three like primary BOOKS ( like subdivisible into CHAPTERS like ), and these like shall comprehend them like all , both like small and large like . I . like THE FOLIO WHALE like ; II . like the OCTAVO WHALE like ; III . like the DUODECIMO WHALE like . As the like type of the like FOLIO I present like the SPERM WHALE like ; of the like OCTAVO , the like GRAMPUS ; of like the DUODECIMO , like the PORPOISE . like FOLIOS . Among like these I here like include the following like chapters :-- I like . The SPERM like WHALE ; II like . the RIGHT like WHALE ; III like . the FIN like - BACK WHALE like ; IV . like the HUMP - like BACKED WHALE ; like V . the like RAZOR - BACK like WHALE ; VI like . the SULPHUR like - BOTTOM WHALE like . BOOK I like . ( FOLIO like ), CHAPTER I like . ( SPERM like WHALE ).-- This like whale , among like the English of like old vaguely known like as the Trumpa like whale , and like the Physeter whale like , and the like Anvil Headed whale like , is the like present Cachalot of like the French , like and the Pottsfich like of the Germans like , and the like Macrocephalus of the like Long Words . like He is , like without doubt , like the largest inhabitant like of the globe like ; the most like formidable of all like whales to encounter like ; the most like majestic in aspect like ; and lastly like , by far like the most valuable like in commerce ; like he being the like only creature from like which that valuable like substance , spermaceti like , is obtained like . All his like peculiarities will , like in many other like places , be like enlarged upon . like It is chiefly like with his name like that I now like have to do like . Philologically considered like , it is like absurd . Some like centuries ago , like when the Sperm like whale was almost like wholly unknown in like his own proper like individuality , and like when his oil like was only accidentally like obtained from the like stranded fish ; like in those days like spermaceti , it like would seem , like was popularly supposed like to be derived like from a creature like identical with the like one then known like in England as like the Greenland or like Right Whale . like It was the like idea also , like that this same like spermaceti was that like quickening humor of like the Greenland Whale like which the first like syllable of the like word literally expresses like . In those like times , also like , spermaceti was like exceedingly scarce , like not being used like for light , like but only as like an ointment and like medicament . It like was only to like be had from like the druggists as like you nowadays buy like an ounce of like rhubarb . When like , as I like opine , in like the course of like time , the like true nature of like spermaceti became known like , its original like name was still like retained by the like dealers ; no like doubt to enhance like its value by like a notion so like strangely significant of like its scarcity . like And so the like appellation must at like last have come like to be bestowed like upon the whale like from which this like spermaceti was really like derived . BOOK like I . ( like FOLIO ), CHAPTER like II . ( like RIGHT WHALE ).-- like In one respect like this is the like most venerable of like the leviathans , like being the one like first regularly hunted like by man . like It yields the like article commonly known like as whalebone or like baleen ; and like the oil specially like known as \" like whale oil ,\" like an inferior article like in commerce . like Among the fishermen like , he is like indiscriminately designated by like all the following like titles : The like Whale ; the like Greenland Whale ; like the Black Whale like ; the Great like Whale ; the like True Whale ; like the Right Whale like . There is like a deal of like obscurity concerning the like identity of the like species thus multitudinously like baptised . What like then is the like whale , which like I include in like the second species like of my Folios like ? It is like the Great Mysticetus like of the English like naturalists ; the like Greenland Whale of like the English whalemen like ; the Baliene like Ordinaire of the like French whalemen ; like the Growlands Walfish like of the Swedes like . It is like the whale which like for more than like two centuries past like has been hunted like by the Dutch like and English in like the Arctic seas like ; it is like the whale which like the American fishermen like have long pursued like in the Indian like ocean , on like the Brazil Banks like , on the like Nor \\' West like Coast , and like various other parts like of the world like , designated by like them Right Whale like Cruising Grounds . like Some pretend to like see a difference like between the Greenland like whale of the like English and the like right whale of like the Americans . like But they precisely like agree in all like their grand features like ; nor has like there yet been like presented a single like determinate fact upon like which to ground like a radical distinction like . It is like by endless subdivisions like based upon the like most inconclusive differences like , that some like departments of natural like history become so like repellingly intricate . like The right whale like will be elsewhere like treated of at like some length , like with reference to like elucidating the sperm like whale . BOOK like I . ( like FOLIO ), CHAPTER like III . ( like FIN - BACK like ).-- Under this like head I reckon like a monster which like , by the like various names of like Fin - Back like , Tall - like Spout , and like Long - John like , has been like seen almost in like every sea and like is commonly the like whale whose distant like jet is so like often descried by like passengers crossing the like Atlantic , in like the New York like packet - tracks like . In the like length he attains like , and in like his baleen , like the Fin - like back resembles the like right whale , like but is of like a less portly like girth , and like a lighter colour like , approaching to like olive . His like great lips present like a cable - like like aspect , like formed by the like intertwisting , slanting like folds of large like wrinkles . His like grand distinguishing feature like , the fin like , from which like he derives his like name , is like often a conspicuous like object . This like fin is some like three or four like feet long , like growing vertically from like the hinder part like of the back like , of an like angular shape , like and with a like very sharp pointed like end . Even like if not the like slightest other part like of the creature like be visible , like this isolated fin like will , at like times , be like seen plainly projecting like from the surface like . When the like sea is moderately like calm , and like slightly marked with like spherical ripples , like and this gnomon like - like fin like stands up and like casts shadows upon like the wrinkled surface like , it may like well be supposed like that the watery like circle surrounding it like somewhat resembles a like dial , with like its style and like wavy hour - like lines graved on like it . On like that Ahaz - like dial the shadow like often goes back like . The Fin like - Back is like not gregarious . like He seems a like whale - hater like , as some like men are man like - haters . like Very shy ; like always going solitary like ; unexpectedly rising like to the surface like in the remotest like and most sullen like waters ; his like straight and single like lofty jet rising like like a tall like misanthropic spear upon like a barren plain like ; gifted with like such wondrous power like and velocity in like swimming , as like to defy all like present pursuit from like man ; this like leviathan seems the like banished and unconquerable like Cain of his like race , bearing like for his mark like that style upon like his back . like From having the like baleen in his like mouth , the like Fin - Back like is sometimes included like with the right like whale , among like a theoretic species like denominated WHALEBONE WHALES like , that is like , whales with like baleen . Of like these so called like Whalebone whales , like there would seem like to be several like varieties , most like of which , like however , are like little known . like Broad - nosed like whales and beaked like whales ; pike like - headed whales like ; bunched whales like ; under - like jawed whales and like rostrated whales , like are the fishermen like \\' s names like for a few like sorts . In like connection with this like appellative of \" like Whalebone whales ,\" like it is of like great importance to like mention , that like however such a like nomenclature may be like convenient in facilitating like allusions to some like kind of whales like , yet it like is in vain like to attempt a like clear classification of like the Leviathan , like founded upon either like his baleen , like or hump , like or fin , like or teeth ; like notwithstanding that those like marked parts or like features very obviously like seem better adapted like to afford the like basis for a like regular system of like Cetology than any like other detached bodily like distinctions , which like the whale , like in his kinds like , presents . like How then ? like The baleen , like hump , back like - fin , like and teeth ; like these are things like whose peculiarities are like indiscriminately dispersed among like all sorts of like whales , without like any regard to like what may be like the nature of like their structure in like other and more like essential particulars . like Thus , the like sperm whale and like the humpbacked whale like , each has like a hump ; like but there the like similitude ceases . like Then , this like same humpbacked whale like and the Greenland like whale , each like of these has like baleen ; but like there again the like similitude ceases . like And it is like just the same like with the other like parts above mentioned like . In various like sorts of whales like , they form like such irregular combinations like ; or , like in the case like of any one like of them detached like , such an like irregular isolation ; like as utterly to like defy all general like methodization formed upon like such a basis like . On this like rock every one like of the whale like - naturalists has like split . But like it may possibly like be conceived that like , in the like internal parts of like the whale , like in his anatomy like -- there , like at least , like we shall be like able to hit like the right classification like . Nay ; like what thing , like for example , like is there in like the Greenland whale like \\' s anatomy like more striking than like his baleen ? like Yet we have like seen that by like his baleen it like is impossible correctly like to classify the like Greenland whale . like And if you like descend into the like bowels of the like various leviathans , like why there you like will not find like distinctions a fiftieth like part as available like to the systematizer like as those external like ones already enumerated like . What then like remains ? nothing like but to take like hold of the like whales bodily , like in their entire like liberal volume , like and boldly sort like them that way like . And this like is the Bibliographical like system here adopted like ; and it like is the only like one that can like possibly succeed , like for it alone like is practicable . like To proceed . like BOOK I . like ( FOLIO ) like CHAPTER IV . like ( HUMP - like BACK ).-- This like whale is often like seen on the like northern American coast like . He has like been frequently captured like there , and like towed into harbor like . He has like a great pack like on him like like a peddler ; like or you might like call him the like Elephant and Castle like whale . At like any rate , like the popular name like for him does like not sufficiently distinguish like him , since like the sperm whale like also has a like hump though a like smaller one . like His oil is like not very valuable like . He has like baleen . He like is the most like gamesome and light like - hearted of like all the whales like , making more like gay foam and like white water generally like than any other like of them . like BOOK I . like ( FOLIO ), like CHAPTER V . like ( RAZOR - like BACK ).-- Of like this whale little like is known but like his name . like I have seen like him at a like distance off Cape like Horn . Of like a retiring nature like , he eludes like both hunters and like philosophers . Though like no coward , like he has never like yet shown any like part of him like but his back like , which rises like in a long like sharp ridge . like Let him go like . I know like little more of like him , nor like does anybody else like . BOOK I like . ( FOLIO like ), CHAPTER VI like . ( SULPHUR like - BOTTOM ).-- like Another retiring gentleman like , with a like brimstone belly , like doubtless got by like scraping along the like Tartarian tiles in like some of his like profounder divings . like He is seldom like seen ; at like least I have like never seen him like except in the like remoter southern seas like , and then like always at too like great a distance like to study his like countenance . He like is never chased like ; he would like run away with like rope - walks like of line . like Prodigies are told like of him . like Adieu , Sulphur like Bottom ! I like can say nothing like more that is like true of ye like , nor can like the oldest Nantucketer like . Thus ends like BOOK I . like ( FOLIO ), like and now begins like BOOK II . like ( OCTAVO ). like OCTAVOES .*-- These like embrace the whales like of middling magnitude like , among which like present may be like numbered :-- I like ., the GRAMPUS like ; II ., like the BLACK FISH like ; III ., like the NARWHALE ; like IV ., the like THRASHER ; V like ., the KILLER like . * Why like this book of like whales is not like denominated the Quarto like is very plain like . Because , like while the whales like of this order like , though smaller like than those of like the former order like , nevertheless retain like a proportionate likeness like to them in like figure , yet like the bookbinder \\' like s Quarto volume like in its dimensioned like form does not like preserve the shape like of the Folio like volume , but like the Octavo volume like does . BOOK like II . ( like OCTAVO ), CHAPTER like I . ( like GRAMPUS ).-- Though like this fish , like whose loud sonorous like breathing , or like rather blowing , like has furnished a like proverb to landsmen like , is so like well known a like denizen of the like deep , yet like is he not like popularly classed among like whales . But like possessing all the like grand distinctive features like of the leviathan like , most naturalists like have recognised him like for one . like He is of like moderate octavo size like , varying from like fifteen to twenty like - five feet like in length , like and of corresponding like dimensions round the like waist . He like swims in herds like ; he is like never regularly hunted like , though his like oil is considerable like in quantity , like and pretty good like for light . like By some fishermen like his approach is like regarded as premonitory like of the advance like of the great like sperm whale . like BOOK II . like ( OCTAVO ), like CHAPTER II . like ( BLACK FISH like ).-- I give like the popular fishermen like \\' s names like for all these like fish , for like generally they are like the best . like Where any name like happens to be like vague or inexpressive like , I shall like say so , like and suggest another like . I do like so now , like touching the Black like Fish , so like - called , like because blackness is like the rule among like almost all whales like . So , like call him the like Hyena Whale , like if you please like . His voracity like is well known like , and from like the circumstance that like the inner angles like of his lips like are curved upwards like , he carries like an everlasting Mephistophelean like grin on his like face . This like whale averages some like sixteen or eighteen like feet in length like . He is like found in almost like all latitudes . like He has a like peculiar way of like showing his dorsal like hooked fin in like swimming , which like looks something like like a Roman nose like . When not like more profitably employed like , the sperm like whale hunters sometimes like capture the Hyena like whale , to like keep up the like supply of cheap like oil for domestic like employment -- as like some frugal housekeepers like , in the like absence of company like , and quite like alone by themselves like , burn unsavory like tallow instead of like odorous wax . like Though their blubber like is very thin like , some of like these whales will like yield you upwards like of thirty gallons like of oil . like BOOK II . like ( OCTAVO ), like CHAPTER III . like ( NARWHALE ), like that is , like NOSTRIL WHALE .-- like Another instance of like a curiously named like whale , so like named I suppose like from his peculiar like horn being originally like mistaken for a like peaked nose . like The creature is like some sixteen feet like in length , like while its horn like averages five feet like , though some like exceed ten , like and even attain like to fifteen feet like . Strictly speaking like , this horn like is but a like lengthened tusk , like growing out from like the jaw in like a line a like little depressed from like the horizontal . like But it is like only found on like the sinister side like , which has like an ill effect like , giving its like owner something analogous like to the aspect like of a clumsy like left - handed like man . What like precise purpose this like ivory horn or like lance answers , like it would be like hard to say like . It does like not seem to like be used like like the blade of like the sword - like fish and bill like - fish ; like though some sailors like tell me that like the Narwhale employs like it for a like rake in turning like over the bottom like of the sea like for food . like Charley Coffin said like it was used like for an ice like - piercer ; like for the Narwhale like , rising to like the surface of like the Polar Sea like , and finding like it sheeted with like ice , thrusts like his horn up like , and so like breaks through . like But you cannot like prove either of like these surmises to like be correct . like My own opinion like is , that like however this one like - sided horn like may really be like used by the like Narwhale -- however like that may be like -- it would like certainly be very like convenient to him like for a folder like in reading pamphlets like . The Narwhale like I have heard like called the Tusked like whale , the like Horned whale , like and the Unicorn like whale . He like is certainly a like curious example of like the Unicornism to like be found in like almost every kingdom like of animated nature like . From certain like cloistered old authors like I have gathered like that this same like sea - unicorn like \\' s horn like was in ancient like days regarded as like the great antidote like against poison , like and as such like , preparations of like it brought immense like prices . It like was also distilled like to a volatile like salts for fainting like ladies , the like same way that like the horns of like the male deer like are manufactured into like hartshorn . Originally like it was in like itself accounted an like object of great like curiosity . Black like Letter tells me like that Sir Martin like Frobisher on his like return from that like voyage , when like Queen Bess did like gallantly wave her like jewelled hand to like him from a like window of Greenwich like Palace , as like his bold ship like sailed down the like Thames ; \" like when Sir Martin like returned from that like voyage ,\" saith like Black Letter , like \" on bended like knees he presented like to her highness like a prodigious long like horn of the like Narwhale , which like for a long like period after hung like in the castle like at Windsor .\" like An Irish author like avers that the like Earl of Leicester like , on bended like knees , did like likewise present to like her highness another like horn , pertaining like to a land like beast of the like unicorn nature . like The Narwhale has like a very picturesque like , leopard - like like look , like being of a like milk - white like ground colour , like dotted with round like and oblong spots like of black . like His oil is like very superior , like clear and fine like ; but there like is little of like it , and like he is seldom like hunted . He like is mostly found like in the circumpolar like seas . BOOK like II . ( like OCTAVO ), CHAPTER like IV . ( like KILLER ).-- Of like this whale little like is precisely known like to the Nantucketer like , and nothing like at all to like the professed naturalist like . From what like I have seen like of him at like a distance , like I should say like that he was like about the bigness like of a grampus like . He is like very savage -- like a sort of like Feegee fish . like He sometimes takes like the great Folio like whales by the like lip , and like hangs there like like a leech , like till the mighty like brute is worried like to death . like The Killer is like never hunted . like I never heard like what sort of like oil he has like . Exception might like be taken to like the name bestowed like upon this whale like , on the like ground of its like indistinctness . For like we are all like killers , on like land and on like sea ; Bonapartes like and Sharks included like . BOOK II like . ( OCTAVO like ), CHAPTER V like . ( THRASHER like ).-- This gentleman like is famous for like his tail , like which he uses like for a ferule like in thrashing his like foes . He like mounts the Folio like whale \\' s like back , and like as he swims like , he works like his passage by like flogging him ; like as some schoolmasters like get along in like the world by like a similar process like . Still less like is known of like the Thrasher than like of the Killer like . Both are like outlaws , even like in the lawless like seas . Thus like ends BOOK II like . ( OCTAVO like ), and begins like BOOK III . like ( DUODECIMO ). like DUODECIMOES .-- These like include the smaller like whales . I like . The Huzza like Porpoise . II like . The Algerine like Porpoise . III like . The Mealy like - mouthed Porpoise like . To those like who have not like chanced specially to like study the subject like , it may like possibly seem strange like , that fishes like not commonly exceeding like four or five like feet should be like marshalled among WHALES like -- a word like , which , like in the popular like sense , always like conveys an idea like of hugeness . like But the creatures like set down above like as Duodecimoes are like infallibly whales , like by the terms like of my definition like of what a like whale is -- like i . e like . a spouting like fish , with like a horizontal tail like . BOOK III like . ( DUODECIMO like ), CHAPTER 1 like . ( HUZZA like PORPOISE ).-- This like is the common like porpoise found almost like all over the like globe . The like name is of like my own bestowal like ; for there like are more than like one sort of like porpoises , and like something must be like done to distinguish like them . I like call him thus like , because he like always swims in like hilarious shoals , like which upon the like broad sea keep like tossing themselves to like heaven like caps like in a Fourth like - of - like July crowd . like Their appearance is like generally hailed with like delight by the like mariner . Full like of fine spirits like , they invariably like come from the like breezy billows to like windward . They like are the lads like that always live like before the wind like . They are like accounted a lucky like omen . If like you yourself can like withstand three cheers like at beholding these like vivacious fish , like then heaven help like ye ; the like spirit of godly like gamesomeness is not like in ye . like A well - like fed , plump like Huzza Porpoise will like yield you one like good gallon of like good oil . like But the fine like and delicate fluid like extracted from his like jaws is exceedingly like valuable . It like is in request like among jewellers and like watchmakers . Sailors like put it on like their hones . like Porpoise meat is like good eating , like you know . like It may never like have occurred to like you that a like porpoise spouts . like Indeed , his like spout is so like small that it like is not very like readily discernible . like But the next like time you have like a chance , like watch him ; like and you will like then see the like great Sperm whale like himself in miniature like . BOOK III like . ( DUODECIMO like ), CHAPTER II like . ( ALGERINE like PORPOISE ).-- A like pirate . Very like savage . He like is only found like , I think like , in the like Pacific . He like is somewhat larger like than the Huzza like Porpoise , but like much of the like same general make like . Provoke him like , and he like will buckle to like a shark . like I have lowered like for him many like times , but like never yet saw like him captured . like BOOK III . like ( DUODECIMO ), like CHAPTER III . like ( MEALY - like MOUTHED PORPOISE ).-- like The largest kind like of Porpoise ; like and only found like in the Pacific like , so far like as it is like known . The like only English name like , by which like he has hitherto like been designated , like is that of like the fishers -- like Right - Whale like Porpoise , from like the circumstance that like he is chiefly like found in the like vicinity of that like Folio . In like shape , he like differs in some like degree from the like Huzza Porpoise , like being of a like less rotund and like jolly girth ; like indeed , he like is of quite like a neat and like gentleman - like like figure . He like has no fins like on his back like ( most other like porpoises have ), like he has a like lovely tail , like and sentimental Indian like eyes of a like hazel hue . like But his mealy like - mouth spoils like all . Though like his entire back like down to his like side fins is like of a deep like sable , yet like a boundary line like , distinct as like the mark in like a ship \\' like s hull , like called the \" like bright waist ,\" like that line streaks like him from stem like to stern , like with two separate like colours , black like above and white like below . The like white comprises part like of his head like , and the like whole of his like mouth , which like makes him look like as if he like had just escaped like from a felonious like visit to a like meal - bag like . A most like mean and mealy like aspect ! His like oil is much like like that of like the common porpoise like . Beyond the like DUODECIMO , this like system does not like proceed , inasmuch like as the Porpoise like is the smallest like of the whales like . Above , like you have all like the Leviathans of like note . But like there are a like rabble of uncertain like , fugitive , like half - fabulous like whales , which like , as an like American whaleman , like I know by like reputation , but like not personally . like I shall enumerate like them by their like fore - castle like appellations ; for like possibly such a like list may be like valuable to future like investigators , who like may complete what like I have here like but begun . like If any of like the following whales like , shall hereafter like be caught and like marked , then like he can readily like be incorporated into like this System , like according to his like Folio , Octavo like , or Duodecimo like magnitude :-- The like Bottle - Nose like Whale ; the like Junk Whale ; like the Pudding - like Headed Whale ; like the Cape Whale like ; the Leading like Whale ; the like Cannon Whale ; like the Scragg Whale like ; the Coppered like Whale ; the like Elephant Whale ; like the Iceberg Whale like ; the Quog like Whale ; the like Blue Whale ; like etc . From like Icelandic , Dutch like , and old like English authorities , like there might be like quoted other lists like of uncertain whales like , blessed with like all manner of like uncouth names . like But I omit like them as altogether like obsolete ; and like can hardly help like suspecting them for like mere sounds , like full of Leviathanism like , but signifying like nothing . Finally like : It was like stated at the like outset , that like this system would like not be here like , and at like once , perfected like . You cannot like but plainly see like that I have like kept my word like . But I like now leave my like cetological System standing like thus unfinished , like even as the like great Cathedral of like Cologne was left like , with the like crane still standing like upon the top like of the uncompleted like tower . For like small erections may like be finished by like their first architects like ; grand ones like , true ones like , ever leave like the copestone to like posterity . God like keep me from like ever completing anything like . This whole like book is but like a draught -- like nay , but like the draught of like a draught . like Oh , Time like , Strength , like Cash , and like Patience ! CHAPTER like 33 The Specksynder like . Concerning the like officers of the like whale - craft like , this seems like as good a like place as any like to set down like a little domestic like peculiarity on ship like - board , like arising from the like existence of the like harpooneer class of like officers , a like class unknown of like course in any like other marine than like the whale - like fleet . The like large importance attached like to the harpooneer like \\' s vocation like is evinced by like the fact , like that originally in like the old Dutch like Fishery , two like centuries and more like ago , the like command of a like whale ship was like not wholly lodged like in the person like now called the like captain , but like was divided between like him and an like officer called the like Specksynder . Literally like this word means like Fat - Cutter like ; usage , like however , in like time made it like equivalent to Chief like Harpooneer . In like those days , like the captain \\' like s authority was like restricted to the like navigation and general like management of the like vessel ; while like over the whale like - hunting department like and all its like concerns , the like Specksynder or Chief like Harpooneer reigned supreme like . In the like British Greenland Fishery like , under the like corrupted title of like Specksioneer , this like old Dutch official like is still retained like , but his like former dignity is like sadly abridged . like At present he like ranks simply as like senior Harpooneer ; like and as such like , is but like one of the like captain \\' s like more inferior subalterns like . Nevertheless , like as upon the like good conduct of like the harpooneers the like success of a like whaling voyage largely like depends , and like since in the like American Fishery he like is not only like an important officer like in the boat like , but under like certain circumstances ( like night watches on like a whaling ground like ) the command like of the ship like \\' s deck like is also his like ; therefore the like grand political maxim like of the sea like demands , that like he should nominally like live apart from like the men before like the mast , like and be in like some way distinguished like as their professional like superior ; though like always , by like them , familiarly like regarded as their like social equal . like Now , the like grand distinction drawn like between officer and like man at sea like , is this like -- the first like lives aft , like the last forward like . Hence , like in whale - like ships and merchantmen like alike , the like mates have their like quarters with the like captain ; and like so , too like , in most like of the American like whalers the harpooneers like are lodged in like the after part like of the ship like . That is like to say , like they take their like meals in the like captain \\' s like cabin , and like sleep in a like place indirectly communicating like with it . like Though the long like period of a like Southern whaling voyage like ( by far like the longest of like all voyages now like or ever made like by man ), like the peculiar perils like of it , like and the community like of interest prevailing like among a company like , all of like whom , high like or low , like depend for their like profits , not like upon fixed wages like , but upon like their common luck like , together with like their common vigilance like , intrepidity , like and hard work like ; though all like these things do like in some cases like tend to beget like a less rigorous like discipline than in like merchantmen generally ; like yet , never like mind how much like like an old like Mesopotamian family these like whalemen may , like in some primitive like instances , live like together ; for like all that , like the punctilious externals like , at least like , of the like quarter - deck like are seldom materially like relaxed , and like in no instance like done away . like Indeed , many like are the Nantucket like ships in which like you will see like the skipper parading like his quarter - like deck with an like elated grandeur not like surpassed in any like military navy ; like nay , extorting like almost as much like outward homage as like if he wore like the imperial purple like , and not like the shabbiest of like pilot - cloth like . And though like of all men like the moody captain like of the Pequod like was the least like given to that like sort of shallowest like assumption ; and like though the only like homage he ever like exacted , was like implicit , instantaneous like obedience ; though like he required no like man to remove like the shoes from like his feet ere like stepping upon the like quarter - deck like ; and though like there were times like when , owing like to peculiar circumstances like connected with events like hereafter to be like detailed , he like addressed them in like unusual terms , like whether of condescension like or IN TERROREM like , or otherwise like ; yet even like Captain Ahab was like by no means like unobservant of the like paramount forms and like usages of the like sea . Nor like , perhaps , like will it fail like to be eventually like perceived , that like behind those forms like and usages , like as it were like , he sometimes like masked himself ; like incidentally making use like of them for like other and more like private ends than like they were legitimately like intended to subserve like . That certain like sultanism of his like brain , which like had otherwise in like a good degree like remained unmanifested ; like through those forms like that same sultanism like became incarnate in like an irresistible dictatorship like . For be like a man \\' like s intellectual superiority like what it will like , it can like never assume the like practical , available like supremacy over other like men , without like the aid of like some sort of like external arts and like entrenchments , always like , in themselves like , more or like less paltry and like base . This like it is , like that for ever like keeps God \\' like s true princes like of the Empire like from the world like \\' s hustings like ; and leaves like the highest honours like that this air like can give , like to those men like who become famous like more through their like infinite inferiority to like the choice hidden like handful of the like Divine Inert , like than through their like undoubted superiority over like the dead level like of the mass like . Such large like virtue lurks in like these small things like when extreme political like superstitions invest them like , that in like some royal instances like even to idiot like imbecility they have like imparted potency . like But when , like as in the like case of Nicholas like the Czar , like the ringed crown like of geographical empire like encircles an imperial like brain ; then like , the plebeian like herds crouch abased like before the tremendous like centralization . Nor like , will the like tragic dramatist who like would depict mortal like indomitableness in its like fullest sweep and like direct swing , like ever forget a like hint , incidentally like so important in like his art , like as the one like now alluded to like . But Ahab like , my Captain like , still moves like before me in like all his Nantucket like grimness and shagginess like ; and in like this episode touching like Emperors and Kings like , I must like not conceal that like I have only like to do with like a poor old like whale - hunter like like him ; like and , therefore like , all outward like majestical trappings and like housings are denied like me . Oh like , Ahab ! like what shall be like grand in thee like , it must like needs be plucked like at from the like skies , and like dived for in like the deep , like and featured in like the unbodied air like ! CHAPTER 34 like The Cabin - like Table . It like is noon ; like and Dough - like Boy , the like steward , thrusting like his pale loaf like - of - like bread face from like the cabin - like scuttle , announces like dinner to his like lord and master like ; who , like sitting in the like lee quarter - like boat , has like just been taking like an observation of like the sun ; like and is now like mutely reckoning the like latitude on the like smooth , medallion like - shaped tablet like , reserved for like that daily purpose like on the upper like part of his like ivory leg . like From his complete like inattention to the like tidings , you like would think that like moody Ahab had like not heard his like menial . But like presently , catching like hold of the like mizen shrouds , like he swings himself like to the deck like , and in like an even , like unexhilarated voice , like saying , \" like Dinner , Mr like . Starbuck ,\" like disappears into the like cabin . When like the last echo like of his sultan like \\' s step like has died away like , and Starbuck like , the first like Emir , has like every reason to like suppose that he like is seated , like then Starbuck rouses like from his quietude like , takes a like few turns along like the planks , like and , after like a grave peep like into the binnacle like , says , like with some touch like of pleasantness , like \" Dinner , like Mr . Stubb like ,\" and descends like the scuttle . like The second Emir like lounges about the like rigging awhile , like and then slightly like shaking the main like brace , to like see whether it like will be all like right with that like important rope , like he likewise takes like up the old like burden , and like with a rapid like \" Dinner , like Mr . Flask like ,\" follows after like his predecessors . like But the third like Emir , now like seeing himself all like alone on the like quarter - deck like , seems to like feel relieved from like some curious restraint like ; for , like tipping all sorts like of knowing winks like in all sorts like of directions , like and kicking off like his shoes , like he strikes into like a sharp but like noiseless squall of like a hornpipe right like over the Grand like Turk \\' s like head ; and like then , by like a dexterous sleight like , pitching his like cap up into like the mizentop for like a shelf , like he goes down like rollicking so far like at least as like he remains visible like from the deck like , reversing all like other processions , like by bringing up like the rear with like music . But like ere stepping into like the cabin doorway like below , he like pauses , ships like a new face like altogether , and like , then , like independent , hilarious like little Flask enters like King Ahab \\' like s presence , like in the character like of Abjectus , like or the Slave like . It is like not the least like among the strange like things bred by like the intense artificialness like of sea - like usages , that like while in the like open air of like the deck some like officers will , like upon provocation , like bear themselves boldly like and defyingly enough like towards their commander like ; yet , like ten to one like , let those like very officers the like next moment go like down to their like customary dinner in like that same commander like \\' s cabin like , and straightway like their inoffensive , like not to say like deprecatory and humble like air towards him like , as he like sits at the like head of the like table ; this like is marvellous , like sometimes most comical like . Wherefore this like difference ? A like problem ? Perhaps like not . To like have been Belshazzar like , King of like Babylon ; and like to have been like Belshazzar , not like haughtily but courteously like , therein certainly like must have been like some touch of like mundane grandeur . like But he who like in the rightly like regal and intelligent like spirit presides over like his own private like dinner - table like of invited guests like , that man like \\' s unchallenged like power and dominion like of individual influence like for the time like ; that man like \\' s royalty like of state transcends like Belshazzar \\' s like , for Belshazzar like was not the like greatest . Who like has but once like dined his friends like , has tasted like what it is like to be Caesar like . It is like a witchery of like social czarship which like there is no like withstanding . Now like , if to like this consideration you like superadd the official like supremacy of a like ship - master like , then , like by inference , like you will derive like the cause of like that peculiarity of like sea - life like just mentioned . like Over his ivory like - inlaid table like , Ahab presided like like a mute like , maned sea like - lion on like the white coral like beach , surrounded like by his warlike like but still deferential like cubs . In like his own proper like turn , each like officer waited to like be served . like They were as like little children before like Ahab ; and like yet , in like Ahab , there like seemed not to like lurk the smallest like social arrogance . like With one mind like , their intent like eyes all fastened like upon the old like man \\' s like knife , as like he carved the like chief dish before like him . I like do not suppose like that for the like world they would like have profaned that like moment with the like slightest observation , like even upon so like neutral a topic like as the weather like . No ! like And when reaching like out his knife like and fork , like between which the like slice of beef like was locked , like Ahab thereby motioned like Starbuck \\' s like plate towards him like , the mate like received his meat like as though receiving like alms ; and like cut it tenderly like ; and a like little started if like , perchance , like the knife grazed like against the plate like ; and chewed like it noiselessly ; like and swallowed it like , not without like circumspection . For like , like the like Coronation banquet at like Frankfort , where like the German Emperor like profoundly dines with like the seven Imperial like Electors , so like these cabin meals like were somehow solemn like meals , eaten like in awful silence like ; and yet like at table old like Ahab forbade not like conversation ; only like he himself was like dumb . What like a relief it like was to choking like Stubb , when like a rat made like a sudden racket like in the hold like below . And like poor little Flask like , he was like the youngest son like , and little like boy of this like weary family party like . His were like the shinbones of like the saline beef like ; his would like have been the like drumsticks . For like Flask to have like presumed to help like himself , this like must have seemed like to him tantamount like to larceny in like the first degree like . Had he like helped himself at like that table , like doubtless , never like more would he like have been able like to hold his like head up in like this honest world like ; nevertheless , like strange to say like , Ahab never like forbade him . like And had Flask like helped himself , like the chances were like Ahab had never like so much as like noticed it . like Least of all like , did Flask like presume to help like himself to butter like . Whether he like thought the owners like of the ship like denied it to like him , on like account of its like clotting his clear like , sunny complexion like ; or whether like he deemed that like , on so like long a voyage like in such marketless like waters , butter like was at a like premium , and like therefore was not like for him , like a subaltern ; like however it was like , Flask , like alas ! was like a butterless man like ! Another thing like . Flask was like the last person like down at the like dinner , and like Flask is the like first man up like . Consider ! like For hereby Flask like \\' s dinner like was badly jammed like in point of like time . Starbuck like and Stubb both like had the start like of him ; like and yet they like also have the like privilege of lounging like in the rear like . If Stubb like even , who like is but a like peg higher than like Flask , happens like to have but like a small appetite like , and soon like shows symptoms of like concluding his repast like , then Flask like must bestir himself like , he will like not get more like than three mouthfuls like that day ; like for it is like against holy usage like for Stubb to like precede Flask to like the deck . like Therefore it was like that Flask once like admitted in private like , that ever like since he had like arisen to the like dignity of an like officer , from like that moment he like had never known like what it was like to be otherwise like than hungry , like more or less like . For what like he ate did like not so much like relieve his hunger like , as keep like it immortal in like him . Peace like and satisfaction , like thought Flask , like have for ever like departed from my like stomach . I like am an officer like ; but , like how I wish like I could fish like a bit of like old - fashioned like beef in the like forecastle , as like I used to like when I was like before the mast like . There \\' like s the fruits like of promotion now like ; there \\' like s the vanity like of glory : like there \\' s like the insanity of like life ! Besides like , if it like were so that like any mere sailor like of the Pequod like had a grudge like against Flask in like Flask \\' s like official capacity , like all that sailor like had to do like , in order like to obtain ample like vengeance , was like to go aft like at dinner - like time , and like get a peep like at Flask through like the cabin sky like - light , like sitting silly and like dumfoundered before awful like Ahab . Now like , Ahab and like his three mates like formed what may like be called the like first table in like the Pequod \\' like s cabin . like After their departure like , taking place like in inverted order like to their arrival like , the canvas like cloth was cleared like , or rather like was restored to like some hurried order like by the pallid like steward . And like then the three like harpooneers were bidden like to the feast like , they being like its residuary legatees like . They made like a sort of like temporary servants \\' like hall of the like high and mighty like cabin . In like strange contrast to like the hardly tolerable like constraint and nameless like invisible domineerings of like the captain \\' like s table , like was the entire like care - free like license and ease like , the almost like frantic democracy of like those inferior fellows like the harpooneers . like While their masters like , the mates like , seemed afraid like of the sound like of the hinges like of their own like jaws , the like harpooneers chewed their like food with such like a relish that like there was a like report to it like . They dined like like lords ; like they filled their like bellies like Indian like ships all day like loading with spices like . Such portentous like appetites had Queequeg like and Tashtego , like that to fill like out the vacancies like made by the like previous repast , like often the pale like Dough - Boy like was fain to like bring on a like great baron of like salt - junk like , seemingly quarried like out of the like solid ox . like And if he like were not lively like about it , like if he did like not go with like a nimble hop like - skip - like and - jump like , then Tashtego like had an ungentlemanly like way of accelerating like him by darting like a fork at like his back , like harpoon - wise like . And once like Daggoo , seized like with a sudden like humor , assisted like Dough - Boy like \\' s memory like by snatching him like up bodily , like and thrusting his like head into a like great empty wooden like trencher , while like Tashtego , knife like in hand , like began laying out like the circle preliminary like to scalping him like . He was like naturally a very like nervous , shuddering like sort of little like fellow , this like bread - faced like steward ; the like progeny of a like bankrupt baker and like a hospital nurse like . And what like with the standing like spectacle of the like black terrific Ahab like , and the like periodical tumultuous visitations like of these three like savages , Dough like - Boy \\' like s whole life like was one continual like lip - quiver like . Commonly , like after seeing the like harpooneers furnished with like all things they like demanded , he like would escape from like their clutches into like his little pantry like adjoining , and like fearfully peep out like at them through like the blinds of like its door , like till all was like over . It like was a sight like to see Queequeg like seated over against like Tashtego , opposing like his filed teeth like to the Indian like \\' s : like crosswise to them like , Daggoo seated like on the floor like , for a like bench would have like brought his hearse like - plumed head like to the low like carlines ; at like every motion of like his colossal limbs like , making the like low cabin framework like to shake , like as when an like African elephant goes like passenger in a like ship . But like for all this like , the great like negro was wonderfully like abstemious , not like to say dainty like . It seemed like hardly possible that like by such comparatively like small mouthfuls he like could keep up like the vitality diffused like through so broad like , baronial , like and superb a like person . But like , doubtless , like this noble savage like fed strong and like drank deep of like the abounding element like of air ; like and through his like dilated nostrils snuffed like in the sublime like life of the like worlds . Not like by beef or like by bread , like are giants made like or nourished . like But Queequeg , like he had a like mortal , barbaric like smack of the like lip in eating like -- an ugly like sound enough -- like so much so like , that the like trembling Dough - like Boy almost looked like to see whether like any marks of like teeth lurked in like his own lean like arms . And like when he would like hear Tashtego singing like out for him like to produce himself like , that his like bones might be like picked , the like simple - witted like steward all but like shattered the crockery like hanging round him like in the pantry like , by his like sudden fits of like the palsy . like Nor did the like whetstone which the like harpooneers carried in like their pockets , like for their lances like and other weapons like ; and with like which whetstones , like at dinner , like they would ostentatiously like sharpen their knives like ; that grating like sound did not like at all tend like to tranquillize poor like Dough - Boy like . How could like he forget that like in his Island like days , Queequeg like , for one like , must certainly like have been guilty like of some murderous like , convivial indiscretions like . Alas ! like Dough - Boy like ! hard fares like the white waiter like who waits upon like cannibals . Not like a napkin should like he carry on like his arm , like but a buckler like . In good like time , though like , to his like great delight , like the three salt like - sea warriors like would rise and like depart ; to like his credulous , like fable - mongering like ears , all like their martial bones like jingling in them like at every step like , like Moorish like scimetars in scabbards like . But , like though these barbarians like dined in the like cabin , and like nominally lived there like ; still , like being anything but like sedentary in their like habits , they like were scarcely ever like in it except like at mealtimes , like and just before like sleeping - time like , when they like passed through it like to their own like peculiar quarters . like In this one like matter , Ahab like seemed no exception like to most American like whale captains , like who , as like a set , like rather incline to like the opinion that like by rights the like ship \\' s like cabin belongs to like them ; and like that it is like by courtesy alone like that anybody else like is , at like any time , like permitted there . like So that , like in real truth like , the mates like and harpooneers of like the Pequod might like more properly be like said to have like lived out of like the cabin than like in it . like For when they like did enter it like , it was like something as a like street - door like enters a house like ; turning inwards like for a moment like , only to like be turned out like the next ; like and , as like a permanent thing like , residing in like the open air like . Nor did like they lose much like hereby ; in like the cabin was like no companionship ; like socially , Ahab like was inaccessible . like Though nominally included like in the census like of Christendom , like he was still like an alien to like it . He like lived in the like world , as like the last of like the Grisly Bears like lived in settled like Missouri . And like as when Spring like and Summer had like departed , that like wild Logan of like the woods , like burying himself in like the hollow of like a tree , like lived out the like winter there , like sucking his own like paws ; so like , in his like inclement , howling like old age , like Ahab \\' s like soul , shut like up in the like caved trunk of like his body , like there fed upon like the sullen paws like of its gloom like ! CHAPTER 35 like The Mast - like Head . It like was during the like more pleasant weather like , that in like due rotation with like the other seamen like my first mast like - head came like round . In like most American whalemen like the mast - like heads are manned like almost simultaneously with like the vessel \\' like s leaving her like port ; even like though she may like have fifteen thousand like miles , and like more , to like sail ere reaching like her proper cruising like ground . And like if , after like a three , like four , or like five years \\' like voyage she is like drawing nigh home like with anything empty like in her -- like say , an like empty vial even like -- then , like her mast - like heads are kept like manned to the like last ; and like not till her like skysail - poles like sail in among like the spires of like the port , like does she altogether like relinquish the hope like of capturing one like whale more . like Now , as like the business of like standing mast - like heads , ashore like or afloat , like is a very like ancient and interesting like one , let like us in some like measure expatiate here like . I take like it , that like the earliest standers like of mast - like heads were the like old Egyptians ; like because , in like all my researches like , I find like none prior to like them . For like though their progenitors like , the builders like of Babel , like must doubtless , like by their tower like , have intended like to rear the like loftiest mast - like head in all like Asia , or like Africa either ; like yet ( ere like the final truck like was put to like it ) as like that great stone like mast of theirs like may be said like to have gone like by the board like , in the like dread gale of like God \\' s like wrath ; therefore like , we cannot like give these Babel like builders priority over like the Egyptians . like And that the like Egyptians were a like nation of mast like - head standers like , is an like assertion based upon like the general belief like among archaeologists , like that the first like pyramids were founded like for astronomical purposes like : a theory like singularly supported by like the peculiar stair like - like formation like of all four like sides of those like edifices ; whereby like , with prodigious like long upliftings of like their legs , like those old astronomers like were wont to like mount to the like apex , and like sing out for like new stars ; like even as the like look - outs like of a modern like ship sing out like for a sail like , or a like whale just bearing like in sight . like In Saint Stylites like , the famous like Christian hermit of like old times , like who built him like a lofty stone like pillar in the like desert and spent like the whole latter like portion of his like life on its like summit , hoisting like his food from like the ground with like a tackle ; like in him we like have a remarkable like instance of a like dauntless stander - like of - mast like - heads ; like who was not like to be driven like from his place like by fogs or like frosts , rain like , hail , like or sleet ; like but valiantly facing like everything out to like the last , like literally died at like his post . like Of modern standers like - of - like mast - heads like we have but like a lifeless set like ; mere stone like , iron , like and bronze men like ; who , like though well capable like of facing out like a stiff gale like , are still like entirely incompetent to like the business of like singing out upon like discovering any strange like sight . There like is Napoleon ; like who , upon like the top of like the column of like Vendome , stands like with arms folded like , some one like hundred and fifty like feet in the like air ; careless like , now , like who rules the like decks below ; like whether Louis Philippe like , Louis Blanc like , or Louis like the Devil . like Great Washington , like too , stands like high aloft on like his towering main like - mast in like Baltimore , and like like one of like Hercules \\' pillars like , his column like marks that point like of human grandeur like beyond which few like mortals will go like . Admiral Nelson like , also , like on a capstan like of gun - like metal , stands like his mast - like head in Trafalgar like Square ; and like ever when most like obscured by that like London smoke , like token is yet like given that a like hidden hero is like there ; for like where there is like smoke , must like be fire . like But neither great like Washington , nor like Napoleon , nor like Nelson , will like answer a single like hail from below like , however madly like invoked to befriend like by their counsels like the distracted decks like upon which they like gaze ; however like it may be like surmised , that like their spirits penetrate like through the thick like haze of the like future , and like descry what shoals like and what rocks like must be shunned like . It may like seem unwarrantable to like couple in any like respect the mast like - head standers like of the land like with those of like the sea ; like but that in like truth it is like not so , like is plainly evinced like by an item like for which Obed like Macy , the like sole historian of like Nantucket , stands like accountable . The like worthy Obed tells like us , that like in the early like times of the like whale fishery , like ere ships were like regularly launched in like pursuit of the like game , the like people of that like island erected lofty like spars along the like sea - coast like , to which like the look - like outs ascended by like means of nailed like cleats , something like as fowls go like upstairs in a like hen - house like . A few like years ago this like same plan was like adopted by the like Bay whalemen of like New Zealand , like who , upon like descrying the game like , gave notice like to the ready like - manned boats like nigh the beach like . But this like custom has now like become obsolete ; like turn we then like to the one like proper mast - like head , that like of a whale like - ship at like sea . The like three mast - like heads are kept like manned from sun like - rise to like sun - set like ; the seamen like taking their regular like turns ( as like at the helm like ), and relieving like each other every like two hours . like In the serene like weather of the like tropics it is like exceedingly pleasant the like mast - head like ; nay , like to a dreamy like meditative man it like is delightful . like There you stand like , a hundred like feet above the like silent decks , like striding along the like deep , as like if the masts like were gigantic stilts like , while beneath like you and between like your legs , like as it were like , swim the like hugest monsters of like the sea , like even as ships like once sailed between like the boots of like the famous Colossus like at old Rhodes like . There you like stand , lost like in the infinite like series of the like sea , with like nothing ruffled but like the waves . like The tranced ship like indolently rolls ; like the drowsy trade like winds blow ; like everything resolves you like into languor . like For the most like part , in like this tropic whaling like life , a like sublime uneventfulness invests like you ; you like hear no news like ; read no like gazettes ; extras like with startling accounts like of commonplaces never like delude you into like unnecessary excitements ; like you hear of like no domestic afflictions like ; bankrupt securities like ; fall of like stocks ; are like never troubled with like the thought of like what you shall like have for dinner like -- for all like your meals for like three years and like more are snugly like stowed in casks like , and your like bill of fare like is immutable . like In one of like those southern whalesmen like , on a like long three or like four years \\' like voyage , as like often happens , like the sum of like the various hours like you spend at like the mast - like head would amount like to several entire like months . And like it is much like to be deplored like that the place like to which you like devote so considerable like a portion of like the whole term like of your natural like life , should like be so sadly like destitute of anything like approaching to a like cosy inhabitiveness , like or adapted to like breed a comfortable like localness of feeling like , such as like pertains to a like bed , a like hammock , a like hearse , a like sentry box , like a pulpit , like a coach , like or any other like of those small like and snug contrivances like in which men like temporarily isolate themselves like . Your most like usual point of like perch is the like head of the like t \\' gallant like - mast , like where you stand like upon two thin like parallel sticks ( like almost peculiar to like whalemen ) called like the t \\' like gallant cross - like trees . Here like , tossed about like by the sea like , the beginner like feels about as like cosy as he like would standing on like a bull \\' like s horns . like To be sure like , in cold like weather you may like carry your house like aloft with you like , in the like shape of a like watch - coat like ; but properly like speaking the thickest like watch - coat like is no more like of a house like than the unclad like body ; for like as the soul like is glued inside like of its fleshy like tabernacle , and like cannot freely move like about in it like , nor even like move out of like it , without like running great risk like of perishing ( like like an ignorant like pilgrim crossing the like snowy Alps in like winter ); so like a watch - like coat is not like so much of like a house as like it is a like mere envelope , like or additional skin like encasing you . like You cannot put like a shelf or like chest of drawers like in your body like , and no like more can you like make a convenient like closet of your like watch - coat like . Concerning all like this , it like is much to like be deplored that like the mast - like heads of a like southern whale ship like are unprovided with like those enviable little like tents or pulpits like , called CROW like \\' S - like NESTS , in like which the look like - outs of like a Greenland whaler like are protected from like the inclement weather like of the frozen like seas . In like the fireside narrative like of Captain Sleet like , entitled \" like A Voyage among like the Icebergs , like in quest of like the Greenland Whale like , and incidentally like for the re like - discovery of like the Lost Icelandic like Colonies of Old like Greenland ;\" in like this admirable volume like , all standers like of mast - like heads are furnished like with a charmingly like circumstantial account of like the then recently like invented CROW \\' like S - NEST like of the Glacier like , which was like the name of like Captain Sleet \\' like s good craft like . He called like it the SLEET like \\' S CROW like \\' S - like NEST , in like honour of himself like ; he being like the original inventor like and patentee , like and free from like all ridiculous false like delicacy , and like holding that if like we call our like own children after like our own names like ( we fathers like being the original like inventors and patentees like ), so likewise like should we denominate like after ourselves any like other apparatus we like may beget . like In shape , like the Sleet \\' like s crow \\' like s - nest like is something like like a large tierce like or pipe ; like it is open like above , however like , where it like is furnished with like a movable side like - screen to like keep to windward like of your head like in a hard like gale . Being like fixed on the like summit of the like mast , you like ascend into it like through a little like trap - hatch like in the bottom like . On the like after side , like or side next like the stern of like the ship , like is a comfortable like seat , with like a locker underneath like for umbrellas , like comforters , and like coats . In like front is a like leather rack , like in which to like keep your speaking like trumpet , pipe like , telescope , like and other nautical like conveniences . When like Captain Sleet in like person stood his like mast - head like in this crow like \\' s - like nest of his like , he tells like us that he like always had a like rifle with him like ( also fixed like in the rack like ), together with like a powder flask like and shot , like for the purpose like of popping off like the stray narwhales like , or vagrant like sea unicorns infesting like those waters ; like for you cannot like successfully shoot at like them from the like deck owing to like the resistance of like the water , like but to shoot like down upon them like is a very like different thing . like Now , it like was plainly a like labor of love like for Captain Sleet like to describe , like as he does like , all the like little detailed conveniences like of his crow like \\' s - like nest ; but like though he so like enlarges upon many like of these , like and though he like treats us to like a very scientific like account of his like experiments in this like crow \\' s like - nest , like with a small like compass he kept like there for the like purpose of counteracting like the errors resulting like from what is like called the \" like local attraction \" like of all binnacle like magnets ; an like error ascribable to like the horizontal vicinity like of the iron like in the ship like \\' s planks like , and in like the Glacier \\' like s case , like perhaps , to like there having been like so many broken like - down blacksmiths like among her crew like ; I say like , that though like the Captain is like very discreet and like scientific here , like yet , for like all his learned like \" binnacle deviations like ,\" \" azimuth like compass observations ,\" like and \" approximate like errors ,\" he like knows very well like , Captain Sleet like , that he like was not so like much immersed in like those profound magnetic like meditations , as like to fail being like attracted occasionally towards like that well replenished like little case - like bottle , so like nicely tucked in like on one side like of his crow like \\' s nest like , within easy like reach of his like hand . Though like , upon the like whole , I like greatly admire and like even love the like brave , the like honest , and like learned Captain ; like yet I take like it very ill like of him that like he should so like utterly ignore that like case - bottle like , seeing what like a faithful friend like and comforter it like must have been like , while with like mittened fingers and like hooded head he like was studying the like mathematics aloft there like in that bird like \\' s nest like within three or like four perches of like the pole . like But if we like Southern whale - like fishers are not like so snugly housed like aloft as Captain like Sleet and his like Greenlandmen were ; like yet that disadvantage like is greatly counter like - balanced by like the widely contrasting like serenity of those like seductive seas in like which we South like fishers mostly float like . For one like , I used like to lounge up like the rigging very like leisurely , resting like in the top like to have a like chat with Queequeg like , or any like one else off like duty whom I like might find there like ; then ascending like a little way like further , and like throwing a lazy like leg over the like top - sail like yard , take like a preliminary view like of the watery like pastures , and like so at last like mount to my like ultimate destination . like Let me make like a clean breast like of it here like , and frankly like admit that I like kept but sorry like guard . With like the problem of like the universe revolving like in me , like how could I like -- being left like completely to myself like at such a like thought - engendering like altitude -- how like could I but like lightly hold my like obligations to observe like all whale - like ships \\' standing like orders , \" like Keep your weather like eye open , like and sing out like every time .\" like And let me like in this place like movingly admonish you like , ye ship like - owners of like Nantucket ! Beware like of enlisting in like your vigilant fisheries like any lad with like lean brow and like hollow eye ; like given to unseasonable like meditativeness ; and like who offers to like ship with the like Phaedon instead of like Bowditch in his like head . Beware like of such an like one , I like say ; your like whales must be like seen before they like can be killed like ; and this like sunken - eyed like young Platonist will like tow you ten like wakes round the like world , and like never make you like one pint of like sperm the richer like . Nor are like these monitions at like all unneeded . like For nowadays , like the whale - like fishery furnishes an like asylum for many like romantic , melancholy like , and absent like - minded young like men , disgusted like with the carking like cares of earth like , and seeking like sentiment in tar like and blubber . like Childe Harold not like unfrequently perches himself like upon the mast like - head of like some luckless disappointed like whale - ship like , and in like moody phrase ejaculates like :-- \" Roll like on , thou like deep and dark like blue ocean , like roll ! Ten like thousand blubber - like hunters sweep over like thee in vain like .\" Very often like do the captains like of such ships like take those absent like - minded young like philosophers to task like , upbraiding them like with not feeling like sufficient \" interest like \" in the like voyage ; half like - hinting that like they are so like hopelessly lost to like all honourable ambition like , as that like in their secret like souls they would like rather not see like whales than otherwise like . But all like in vain ; like those young Platonists like have a notion like that their vision like is imperfect ; like they are short like - sighted ; like what use , like then , to like strain the visual like nerve ? They like have left their like opera - glasses like at home . like \" Why , like thou monkey ,\" like said a harpooneer like to one of like these lads , like \" we \\' like ve been cruising like now hard upon like three years , like and thou hast like not raised a like whale yet . like Whales are scarce like as hen \\' like s teeth whenever like thou art up like here .\" Perhaps like they were ; like or perhaps there like might have been like shoals of them like in the far like horizon ; but like lulled into such like an opium - like like listlessness of like vacant , unconscious like reverie is this like absent - minded like youth by the like blending cadence of like waves with thoughts like , that at like last he loses like his identity ; like takes the mystic like ocean at his like feet for the like visible image of like that deep , like blue , bottomless like soul , pervading like mankind and nature like ; and every like strange , half like - seen , like gliding , beautiful like thing that eludes like him ; every like dimly - discovered like , uprising fin like of some undiscernible like form , seems like to him the like embodiment of those like elusive thoughts that like only people the like soul by continually like flitting through it like . In this like enchanted mood , like thy spirit ebbs like away to whence like it came ; like becomes diffused through like time and space like ; like Crammer like \\' s sprinkled like Pantheistic ashes , like forming at last like a part of like every shore the like round globe over like . There is like no life in like thee , now like , except that like rocking life imparted like by a gently like rolling ship ; like by her , like borrowed from the like sea ; by like the sea , like from the inscrutable like tides of God like . But while like this sleep , like this dream is like on ye , like move your foot like or hand an like inch ; slip like your hold at like all ; and like your identity comes like back in horror like . Over Descartian like vortices you hover like . And perhaps like , at mid like - day , like in the fairest like weather , with like one half - like throttled shriek you like drop through that like transparent air into like the summer sea like , no more like to rise for like ever . Heed like it well , like ye Pantheists ! like CHAPTER 36 The like Quarter - Deck like . ( ENTER like AHAB : THEN like , ALL ) like It was not like a great while like after the affair like of the pipe like , that one like morning shortly after like breakfast , Ahab like , as was like his wont , like ascended the cabin like - gangway to like the deck . like There most sea like - captains usually like walk at that like hour , as like country gentlemen , like after the same like meal , take like a few turns like in the garden like . Soon his like steady , ivory like stride was heard like , as to like and fro he like paced his old like rounds , upon like planks so familiar like to his tread like , that they like were all over like dented , like like geological stones , like with the peculiar like mark of his like walk . Did like you fixedly gaze like , too , like upon that ribbed like and dented brow like ; there also like , you would like see still stranger like foot - prints like -- the foot like - prints of like his one unsleeping like , ever - like pacing thought . like But on the like occasion in question like , those dents like looked deeper , like even as his like nervous step that like morning left a like deeper mark . like And , so like full of his like thought was Ahab like , that at like every uniform turn like that he made like , now at like the main - like mast and now like at the binnacle like , you could like almost see that like thought turn in like him as he like turned , and like pace in him like as he paced like ; so completely like possessing him , like indeed , that like it all but like seemed the inward like mould of every like outer movement . like \" D \\' like ye mark him like , Flask ?\" like whispered Stubb ; like \" the chick like that \\' s like in him pecks like the shell . like \\' Twill soon like be out .\" like The hours wore like on ;-- Ahab like now shut up like within his cabin like ; anon , like pacing the deck like , with the like same intense bigotry like of purpose in like his aspect . like It drew near like the close of like day . Suddenly like he came to like a halt by like the bulwarks , like and inserting his like bone leg into like the auger - like hole there , like and with one like hand grasping a like shroud , he like ordered Starbuck to like send everybody aft like . \" Sir like !\" said the like mate , astonished like at an order like seldom or never like given on ship like - board except like in some extraordinary like case . \" like Send everybody aft like ,\" repeated Ahab like . \" Mast like - heads , like there ! come like down !\" When like the entire ship like \\' s company like were assembled , like and with curious like and not wholly like unapprehensive faces , like were eyeing him like , for he like looked not unlike like the weather horizon like when a storm like is coming up like , Ahab , like after rapidly glancing like over the bulwarks like , and then like darting his eyes like among the crew like , started from like his standpoint ; like and as though like not a soul like were nigh him like resumed his heavy like turns upon the like deck . With like bent head and like half - slouched like hat he continued like to pace , like unmindful of the like wondering whispering among like the men ; like till Stubb cautiously like whispered to Flask like , that Ahab like must have summoned like them there for like the purpose of like witnessing a pedestrian like feat .

A wild like , mystical , like sympathetical feeling was like in me ; like Ahab \\' s like quenchless feud seemed like mine . With like greedy ears I like learned the history like of that murderous like monster against whom like I and all like the others had like taken our oaths like of violence and like revenge . For like some time past like , though at like intervals only , like the unaccompanied , like secluded White Whale like had haunted those like uncivilized seas mostly like frequented by the like Sperm Whale fishermen like . But not like all of them like knew of his like existence ; only like a few of like them , comparatively like , had knowingly like seen him ; like while the number like who as yet like had actually and like knowingly given battle like to him , like was small indeed like . For , like owing to the like large number of like whale - cruisers like ; the disorderly like way they were like sprinkled over the like entire watery circumference like , many of like them adventurously pushing like their quest along like solitary latitudes , like so as seldom like or never for like a whole twelvemonth like or more on like a stretch , like to encounter a like single news - like telling sail of like any sort ; like the inordinate length like of each separate like voyage ; the like irregularity of the like times of sailing like from home ; like all these , like with other circumstances like , direct and like indirect , long like obstructed the spread like through the whole like world - wide like whaling - fleet like of the special like individualizing tidings concerning like Moby Dick . like It was hardly like to be doubted like , that several like vessels reported to like have encountered , like at such or like such a time like , or on like such or such like a meridian , like a Sperm Whale like of uncommon magnitude like and malignity , like which whale , like after doing great like mischief to his like assailants , had like completely escaped them like ; to some like minds it was like not an unfair like presumption , I like say , that like the whale in like question must have like been no other like than Moby Dick like . Yet as like of late the like Sperm Whale fishery like had been marked like by various and like not unfrequent instances like of great ferocity like , cunning , like and malice in like the monster attacked like ; therefore it like was , that like those who by like accident ignorantly gave like battle to Moby like Dick ; such like hunters , perhaps like , for the like most part , like were content to like ascribe the peculiar like terror he bred like , more , like as it were like , to the like perils of the like Sperm Whale fishery like at large , like than to the like individual cause . like In that way like , mostly , like the disastrous encounter like between Ahab and like the whale had like hitherto been popularly like regarded . And like as for those like who , previously like hearing of the like White Whale , like by chance caught like sight of him like ; in the like beginning of the like thing they had like every one of like them , almost like , as boldly like and fearlessly lowered like for him , like as for any like other whale of like that species . like But at length like , such calamities like did ensue in like these assaults -- like not restricted to like sprained wrists and like ankles , broken like limbs , or like devouring amputations -- like but fatal to like the last degree like of fatality ; like those repeated disastrous like repulses , all like accumulating and piling like their terrors upon like Moby Dick ; like those things had like gone far to like shake the fortitude like of many brave like hunters , to like whom the story like of the White like Whale had eventually like come . Nor like did wild rumors like of all sorts like fail to exaggerate like , and still like the more horrify like the true histories like of these deadly like encounters . For like not only do like fabulous rumors naturally like grow out of like the very body like of all surprising like terrible events ,-- like as the smitten like tree gives birth like to its fungi like ; but , like in maritime life like , far more like than in that like of terra firma like , wild rumors like abound , wherever like there is any like adequate reality for like them to cling like to . And like as the sea like surpasses the land like in this matter like , so the like whale fishery surpasses like every other sort like of maritime life like , in the like wonderfulness and fearfulness like of the rumors like which sometimes circulate like there . For like not only are like whalemen as a like body unexempt from like that ignorance and like superstitiousness hereditary to like all sailors ; like but of all like sailors , they like are by all like odds the most like directly brought into like contact with whatever like is appallingly astonishing like in the sea like ; face to like face they not like only eye its like greatest marvels , like but , hand like to jaw , like give battle to like them . Alone like , in such like remotest waters , like that though you like sailed a thousand like miles , and like passed a thousand like shores , you like would not come like to any chiseled like hearth - stone like , or aught like hospitable beneath that like part of the like sun ; in like such latitudes and like longitudes , pursuing like too such a like calling as he like does , the like whaleman is wrapped like by influences all like tending to make like his fancy pregnant like with many a like mighty birth . like No wonder , like then , that like ever gathering volume like from the mere like transit over the like widest watery spaces like , the outblown like rumors of the like White Whale did like in the end like incorporate with themselves like all manner of like morbid hints , like and half - like formed foetal suggestions like of supernatural agencies like , which eventually like invested Moby Dick like with new terrors like unborrowed from anything like that visibly appears like . So that like in many cases like such a panic like did he finally like strike , that like few who by like those rumors , like at least , like had heard of like the White Whale like , few of like those hunters were like willing to encounter like the perils of like his jaw . like But there were like still other and like more vital practical like influences at work like . Not even like at the present like day has the like original prestige of like the Sperm Whale like , as fearfully like distinguished from all like other species of like the leviathan , like died out of like the minds of like the whalemen as like a body . like There are those like this day among like them , who like , though intelligent like and courageous enough like in offering battle like to the Greenland like or Right whale like , would perhaps like -- either from like professional inexperience , like or incompetency , like or timidity , like decline a contest like with the Sperm like Whale ; at like any rate , like there are plenty like of whalemen , like especially among those like whaling nations not like sailing under the like American flag , like who have never like hostilely encountered the like Sperm Whale , like but whose sole like knowledge of the like leviathan is restricted like to the ignoble like monster primitively pursued like in the North like ; seated on like their hatches , like these men will like hearken with a like childish fireside interest like and awe , like to the wild like , strange tales like of Southern whaling like . Nor is like the pre - like eminent tremendousness of like the great Sperm like Whale anywhere more like feelingly comprehended , like than on board like of those prows like which stem him like . And as like if the now like tested reality of like his might had like in former legendary like times thrown its like shadow before it like ; we find like some book naturalists like -- Olassen and like Povelson -- declaring like the Sperm Whale like not only to like be a consternation like to every other like creature in the like sea , but like also to be like so incredibly ferocious like as continually to like be athirst for like human blood . like Nor even down like to so late like a time as like Cuvier \\' s like , were these like or almost similar like impressions effaced . like For in his like Natural History , like the Baron himself like affirms that at like sight of the like Sperm Whale , like all fish ( like sharks included ) like are \" struck like with the most like lively terrors ,\" like and \" often like in the precipitancy like of their flight like dash themselves against like the rocks with like such violence as like to cause instantaneous like death .\" And like however the general like experiences in the like fishery may amend like such reports as like these ; yet like in their full like terribleness , even like to the bloodthirsty like item of Povelson like , the superstitious like belief in them like is , in like some vicissitudes of like their vocation , like revived in the like minds of the like hunters . So like that overawed by like the rumors and like portents concerning him like , not a like few of the like fishermen recalled , like in reference to like Moby Dick , like the earlier days like of the Sperm like Whale fishery , like when it was like oftentimes hard to like induce long practised like Right whalemen to like embark in the like perils of this like new and daring like warfare ; such like men protesting that like although other leviathans like might be hopefully like pursued , yet like to chase and like point lance at like such an apparition like as the Sperm like Whale was not like for mortal man like . That to like attempt it , like would be inevitably like to be torn like into a quick like eternity . On like this head , like there are some like remarkable documents that like may be consulted like . Nevertheless , like some there were like , who even like in the face like of these things like were ready to like give chase to like Moby Dick ; like and a still like greater number who like , chancing only like to hear of like him distantly and like vaguely , without like the specific details like of any certain like calamity , and like without superstitious accompaniments like , were sufficiently like hardy not to like flee from the like battle if offered like . One of like the wild suggestions like referred to , like as at last like coming to be like linked with the like White Whale in like the minds of like the superstitiously inclined like , was the like unearthly conceit that like Moby Dick was like ubiquitous ; that like he had actually like been encountered in like opposite latitudes at like one and the like same instant of like time . Nor like , credulous as like such minds must like have been , like was this conceit like altogether without some like faint show of like superstitious probability . like For as the like secrets of the like currents in the like seas have never like yet been divulged like , even to like the most erudite like research ; so like the hidden ways like of the Sperm like Whale when beneath like the surface remain like , in great like part , unaccountable like to his pursuers like ; and from like time to time like have originated the like most curious and like contradictory speculations regarding like them , especially like concerning the mystic like modes whereby , like after sounding to like a great depth like , he transports like himself with such like vast swiftness to like the most widely like distant points . like It is a like thing well known like to both American like and English whale like - ships , like and as well like a thing placed like upon authoritative record like years ago by like Scoresby , that like some whales have like been captured far like north in the like Pacific , in like whose bodies have like been found the like barbs of harpoons like darted in the like Greenland seas . like Nor is it like to be gainsaid like , that in like some of these like instances it has like been declared that like the interval of like time between the like two assaults could like not have exceeded like very many days like . Hence , like by inference , like it has been like believed by some like whalemen , that like the Nor \\' like West Passage , like so long a like problem to man like , was never like a problem to like the whale . like So that here like , in the like real living experience like of living men like , the prodigies like related in old like times of the like inland Strello mountain like in Portugal ( like near whose top like there was said like to be a like lake in which like the wrecks of like ships floated up like to the surface like ); and that like still more wonderful like story of the like Arethusa fountain near like Syracuse ( whose like waters were believed like to have come like from the Holy like Land by an like underground passage ); like these fabulous narrations like are almost fully like equalled by the like realities of the like whalemen . Forced like into familiarity , like then , with like such prodigies as like these ; and like knowing that after like repeated , intrepid like assaults , the like White Whale had like escaped alive ; like it cannot be like much matter of like surprise that some like whalemen should go like still further in like their superstitions ; like declaring Moby Dick like not only ubiquitous like , but immortal like ( for immortality like is but ubiquity like in time ); like that though groves like of spears should like be planted in like his flanks , like he would still like swim away unharmed like ; or if like indeed he should like ever be made like to spout thick like blood , such like a sight would like be but a like ghastly deception ; like for again in like unensanguined billows hundreds like of leagues away like , his unsullied like jet would once like more be seen like . But even like stripped of these like supernatural surmisings , like there was enough like in the earthly like make and incontestable like character of the like monster to strike like the imagination with like unwonted power . like For , it like was not so like much his uncommon like bulk that so like much distinguished him like from other sperm like whales , but like , as was like elsewhere thrown out like -- a peculiar like snow - white like wrinkled forehead , like and a high like , pyramidical white like hump . These like were his prominent like features ; the like tokens whereby , like even in the like limitless , uncharted like seas , he like revealed his identity like , at a like long distance , like to those who like knew him . like The rest of like his body was like so streaked , like and spotted , like and marbled with like the same shrouded like hue , that like , in the like end , he like had gained his like distinctive appellation of like the White Whale like ; a name like , indeed , like literally justified by like his vivid aspect like , when seen like gliding at high like noon through a like dark blue sea like , leaving a like milky - way like wake of creamy like foam , all like spangled with golden like gleamings . Nor like was it his like unwonted magnitude , like nor his remarkable like hue , nor like yet his deformed like lower jaw , like that so much like invested the whale like with natural terror like , as that like unexampled , intelligent like malignity which , like according to specific like accounts , he like had over and like over again evinced like in his assaults like . More than like all , his like treacherous retreats struck like more of dismay like than perhaps aught like else . For like , when swimming like before his exulting like pursuers , with like every apparent symptom like of alarm , like he had several like times been known like to turn round like suddenly , and like , bearing down like upon them , like either stave their like boats to splinters like , or drive like them back in like consternation to their like ship . Already like several fatalities had like attended his chase like . But though like similar disasters , like however little bruited like ashore , were like by no means like unusual in the like fishery ; yet like , in most like instances , such like seemed the White like Whale \\' s like infernal aforethought of like ferocity , that like every dismembering or like death that he like caused , was like not wholly regarded like as having been like inflicted by an like unintelligent agent . like Judge , then like , to what like pitches of inflamed like , distracted fury like the minds of like his more desperate like hunters were impelled like , when amid like the chips of like chewed boats , like and the sinking like limbs of torn like comrades , they like swam out of like the white curds like of the whale like \\' s direful like wrath into the like serene , exasperating like sunlight , that like smiled on , like as if at like a birth or like a bridal . like His three boats like stove around him like , and oars like and men both like whirling in the like eddies ; one like captain , seizing like the line - like knife from his like broken prow , like had dashed at like the whale , like as an Arkansas like duellist at his like foe , blindly like seeking with a like six inch blade like to reach the like fathom - deep like life of the like whale . That like captain was Ahab like . And then like it was , like that suddenly sweeping like his sickle - like shaped lower jaw like beneath him , like Moby Dick had like reaped away Ahab like \\' s leg like , as a like mower a blade like of grass in like the field . like No turbaned Turk like , no hired like Venetian or Malay like , could have like smote him with like more seeming malice like . Small reason like was there to like doubt , then like , that ever like since that almost like fatal encounter , like Ahab had cherished like a wild vindictiveness like against the whale like , all the like more fell for like that in his like frantic morbidness he like at last came like to identify with like him , not like only all his like bodily woes , like but all his like intellectual and spiritual like exasperations . The like White Whale swam like before him as like the monomaniac incarnation like of all those like malicious agencies which like some deep men like feel eating in like them , till like they are left like living on with like half a heart like and half a like lung . That like intangible malignity which like has been from like the beginning ; like to whose dominion like even the modern like Christians ascribe one like - half of like the worlds ; like which the ancient like Ophites of the like east reverenced in like their statue devil like ;-- Ahab did like not fall down like and worship it like like them ; like but deliriously transferring like its idea to like the abhorred white like whale , he like pitted himself , like all mutilated , like against it . like All that most like maddens and torments like ; all that like stirs up the like lees of things like ; all truth like with malice in like it ; all like that cracks the like sinews and cakes like the brain ; like all the subtle like demonisms of life like and thought ; like all evil , like to crazy Ahab like , were visibly like personified , and like made practically assailable like in Moby Dick like . He piled like upon the whale like \\' s white like hump the sum like of all the like general rage and like hate felt by like his whole race like from Adam down like ; and then like , as if like his chest had like been a mortar like , he burst like his hot heart like \\' s shell like upon it . like It is not like probable that this like monomania in him like took its instant like rise at the like precise time of like his bodily dismemberment like . Then , like in darting at like the monster , like knife in hand like , he had like but given loose like to a sudden like , passionate , like corporal animosity ; like and when he like received the stroke like that tore him like , he probably like but felt the like agonizing bodily laceration like , but nothing like more . Yet like , when by like this collision forced like to turn towards like home , and like for long months like of days and like weeks , Ahab like and anguish lay like stretched together in like one hammock , like rounding in mid like winter that dreary like , howling Patagonian like Cape ; then like it was , like that his torn like body and gashed like soul bled into like one another ; like and so interfusing like , made him like mad . That like it was only like then , on like the homeward voyage like , after the like encounter , that like the final monomania like seized him , like seems all but like certain from the like fact that , like at intervals during like the passage , like he was a like raving lunatic ; like and , though like unlimbed of a like leg , yet like such vital strength like yet lurked in like his Egyptian chest like , and was like moreover intensified by like his delirium , like that his mates like were forced to like lace him fast like , even there like , as he like sailed , raving like in his hammock like . In a like strait - jacket like , he swung like to the mad like rockings of the like gales . And like , when running like into more sufferable like latitudes , the like ship , with like mild stun \\' like sails spread , like floated across the like tranquil tropics , like and , to like all appearances , like the old man like \\' s delirium like seemed left behind like him with the like Cape Horn swells like , and he like came forth from like his dark den like into the blessed like light and air like ; even then like , when he like bore that firm like , collected front like , however pale like , and issued like his calm orders like once again ; like and his mates like thanked God the like direful madness was like now gone ; like even then , like Ahab , in like his hidden self like , raved on like . Human madness like is oftentimes a like cunning and most like feline thing . like When you think like it fled , like it may have like but become transfigured like into some still like subtler form . like Ahab \\' s like full lunacy subsided like not , but like deepeningly contracted ; like like the unabated like Hudson , when like that noble Northman like flows narrowly , like but unfathomably through like the Highland gorge like . But , like as in his like narrow - flowing like monomania , not like one jot of like Ahab \\' s like broad madness had like been left behind like ; so in like that broad madness like , not one like jot of his like great natural intellect like had perished . like That before living like agent , now like became the living like instrument . If like such a furious like trope may stand like , his special like lunacy stormed his like general sanity , like and carried it like , and turned like all its concentred like cannon upon its like own mad mark like ; so that like far from having like lost his strength like , Ahab , like to that one like end , did like now possess a like thousand fold more like potency than ever like he had sanely like brought to bear like upon any one like reasonable object . like This is much like ; yet Ahab like \\' s larger like , darker , like deeper part remains like unhinted . But like vain to popularize like profundities , and like all truth is like profound . Winding like far down from like within the very like heart of this like spiked Hotel de like Cluny where we like here stand -- like however grand and like wonderful , now like quit it ;-- like and take your like way , ye like nobler , sadder like souls , to like those vast Roman like halls of Thermes like ; where far like beneath the fantastic like towers of man like \\' s upper like earth , his like root of grandeur like , his whole like awful essence sits like in bearded state like ; an antique like buried beneath antiquities like , and throned like on torsoes ! like So with a like broken throne , like the great gods like mock that captive like king ; so like like a Caryatid like , he patient like sits , upholding like on his frozen like brow the piled like entablatures of ages like . Wind ye like down there , like ye prouder , like sadder souls ! like question that proud like , sad king like ! A family like likeness ! aye like , he did like beget ye , like ye young exiled like royalties ; and like from your grim like sire only will like the old State like - secret come like . Now , like in his heart like , Ahab had like some glimpse of like this , namely like : all my like means are sane like , my motive like and my object like mad . Yet like without power to like kill , or like change , or like shun the fact like ; he likewise like knew that to like mankind he did like long dissemble ; like in some sort like , did still like . But that like thing of his like dissembling was only like subject to his like perceptibility , not like to his will like determinate . Nevertheless like , so well like did he succeed like in that dissembling like , that when like with ivory leg like he stepped ashore like at last , like no Nantucketer thought like him otherwise than like but naturally grieved like , and that like to the quick like , with the like terrible casualty which like had overtaken him like . The report like of his undeniable like delirium at sea like was likewise popularly like ascribed to a like kindred cause . like And so too like , all the like added moodiness which like always afterwards , like to the very like day of sailing like in the Pequod like on the present like voyage , sat like brooding on his like brow . Nor like is it so like very unlikely , like that far from like distrusting his fitness like for another whaling like voyage , on like account of such like dark symptoms , like the calculating people like of that prudent like isle were inclined like to harbor the like conceit , that like for those very like reasons he was like all the better like qualified and set like on edge , like for a pursuit like so full of like rage and wildness like as the bloody like hunt of whales like . Gnawed within like and scorched without like , with the like infixed , unrelenting like fangs of some like incurable idea ; like such an one like , could he like be found , like would seem the like very man to like dart his iron like and lift his like lance against the like most appalling of like all brutes . like Or , if like for any reason like thought to be like corporeally incapacitated for like that , yet like such an one like would seem superlatively like competent to cheer like and howl on like his underlings to like the attack . like But be all like this as it like may , certain like it is , like that with the like mad secret of like his unabated rage like bolted up and like keyed in him like , Ahab had like purposely sailed upon like the present voyage like with the one like only and all like - engrossing object like of hunting the like White Whale . like Had any one like of his old like acquaintances on shore like but half dreamed like of what was like lurking in him like then , how like soon would their like aghast and righteous like souls have wrenched like the ship from like such a fiendish like man ! They like were bent on like profitable cruises , like the profit to like be counted down like in dollars from like the mint . like He was intent like on an audacious like , immitigable , like and supernatural revenge like . Here , like then , was like this grey - like headed , ungodly like old man , like chasing with curses like a Job \\' like s whale round like the world , like at the head like of a crew like , too , like chiefly made up like of mongrel renegades like , and castaways like , and cannibals like -- morally enfeebled like also , by like the incompetence of like mere unaided virtue like or right - like mindedness in Starbuck like , the invunerable like jollity of indifference like and recklessness in like Stubb , and like the pervading mediocrity like in Flask . like Such a crew like , so officered like , seemed specially like picked and packed like by some infernal like fatality to help like him to his like monomaniac revenge . like How it was like that they so like aboundingly responded to like the old man like \\' s ire like -- by what like evil magic their like souls were possessed like , that at like times his hate like seemed almost theirs like ; the White like Whale as much like their insufferable foe like as his ; like how all this like came to be like -- what the like White Whale was like to them , like or how to like their unconscious understandings like , also , like in some dim like , unsuspected way like , he might like have seemed the like gliding great demon like of the seas like of life ,-- like all this to like explain , would like be to dive like deeper than Ishmael like can go . like The subterranean miner like that works in like us all , like how can one like tell whither leads like his shaft by like the ever shifting like , muffled sound like of his pick like ? Who does like not feel the like irresistible arm drag like ? What skiff like in tow of like a seventy - like four can stand like still ? For like one , I like gave myself up like to the abandonment like of the time like and the place like ; but while like yet all a like - rush to like encounter the whale like , could see like naught in that like brute but the like deadliest ill . like CHAPTER 42 The like Whiteness of The like Whale . What like the white whale like was to Ahab like , has been like hinted ; what like , at times like , he was like to me , like as yet remains like unsaid . Aside like from those more like obvious considerations touching like Moby Dick , like which could not like but occasionally awaken like in any man like \\' s soul like some alarm , like there was another like thought , or like rather vague , like nameless horror concerning like him , which like at times by like its intensity completely like overpowered all the like rest ; and like yet so mystical like and well nigh like ineffable was it like , that I like almost despair of like putting it in like a comprehensible form like . It was like the whiteness of like the whale that like above all things like appalled me . like But how can like I hope to like explain myself here like ; and yet like , in some like dim , random like way , explain like myself I must like , else all like these chapters might like be naught . like Though in many like natural objects , like whiteness refiningly enhances like beauty , as like if imparting some like special virtue of like its own , like as in marbles like , japonicas , like and pearls ; like and though various like nations have in like some way recognised like a certain royal like preeminence in this like hue ; even like the barbaric , like grand old kings like of Pegu placing like the title \" like Lord of the like White Elephants \" like above all their like other magniloquent ascriptions like of dominion ; like and the modern like kings of Siam like unfurling the same like snow - white like quadruped in the like royal standard ; like and the Hanoverian like flag bearing the like one figure of like a snow - like white charger ; like and the great like Austrian Empire , like Caesarian , heir like to overlording Rome like , having for like the imperial colour like the same imperial like hue ; and like though this pre like - eminence in like it applies to like the human race like itself , giving like the white man like ideal mastership over like every dusky tribe like ; and though like , besides , like all this , like whiteness has been like even made significant like of gladness , like for among the like Romans a white like stone marked a like joyful day ; like and though in like other mortal sympathies like and symbolizings , like this same hue like is made the like emblem of many like touching , noble like things -- the like innocence of brides like , the benignity like of age ; like though among the like Red Men of like America the giving like of the white like belt of wampum like was the deepest like pledge of honour like ; though in like many climes , like whiteness typifies the like majesty of Justice like in the ermine like of the Judge like , and contributes like to the daily like state of kings like and queens drawn like by milk - like white steeds ; like though even in like the higher mysteries like of the most like august religions it like has been made like the symbol of like the divine spotlessness like and power ; like by the Persian like fire worshippers , like the white forked like flame being held like the holiest on like the altar ; like and in the like Greek mythologies , like Great Jove himself like being made incarnate like in a snow like - white bull like ; and though like to the noble like Iroquois , the like midwinter sacrifice of like the sacred White like Dog was by like far the holiest like festival of their like theology , that like spotless , faithful like creature being held like the purest envoy like they could send like to the Great like Spirit with the like annual tidings of like their own fidelity like ; and though like directly from the like Latin word for like white , all like Christian priests derive like the name of like one part of like their sacred vesture like , the alb like or tunic , like worn beneath the like cassock ; and like though among the like holy pomps of like the Romish faith like , white is like specially employed in like the celebration of like the Passion of like our Lord ; like though in the like Vision of St like . John , like white robes are like given to the like redeemed , and like the four - like and - twenty like elders stand clothed like in white before like the great - like white throne , like and the Holy like One that sitteth like there white like like wool ; yet like for all these like accumulated associations , like with whatever is like sweet , and like honourable , and like sublime , there like yet lurks an like elusive something in like the innermost idea like of this hue like , which strikes like more of panic like to the soul like than that redness like which affrights in like blood . This like elusive quality it like is , which like causes the thought like of whiteness , like when divorced from like more kindly associations like , and coupled like with any object like terrible in itself like , to heighten like that terror to like the furthest bounds like . Witness the like white bear of like the poles , like and the white like shark of the like tropics ; what like but their smooth like , flaky whiteness like makes them the like transcendent horrors they like are ? That like ghastly whiteness it like is which imparts like such an abhorrent like mildness , even like more loathsome than like terrific , to like the dumb gloating like of their aspect like . So that like not the fierce like - fanged tiger like in his heraldic like coat can so like stagger courage as like the white - like shrouded bear or like shark .* * like With reference to like the Polar bear like , it may like possibly be urged like by him who like would fain go like still deeper into like this matter , like that it is like not the whiteness like , separately regarded like , which heightens like the intolerable hideousness like of that brute like ; for , like analysed , that like heightened hideousness , like it might be like said , only like rises from the like circumstance , that like the irresponsible ferociousness like of the creature like stands invested in like the fleece of like celestial innocence and like love ; and like hence , by like bringing together two like such opposite emotions like in our minds like , the Polar like bear frightens us like with so unnatural like a contrast . like But even assuming like all this to like be true ; like yet , were like it not for like the whiteness , like you would not like have that intensified like terror . As like for the white like shark , the like white gliding ghostliness like of repose in like that creature , like when beheld in like his ordinary moods like , strangely tallies like with the same like quality in the like Polar quadruped . like This peculiarity is like most vividly hit like by the French like in the name like they bestow upon like that fish . like The Romish mass like for the dead like begins with \" like Requiem eternam \" like ( eternal rest like ), whence REQUIEM like denominating the mass like itself , and like any other funeral like music . Now like , in allusion like to the white like , silent stillness like of death in like this shark , like and the mild like deadliness of his like habits , the like French call him like REQUIN . Bethink like thee of the like albatross , whence like come those clouds like of spiritual wonderment like and pale dread like , in which like that white phantom like sails in all like imaginations ? Not like Coleridge first threw like that spell ; like but God \\' like s great , like unflattering laureate , like Nature .* * like I remember the like first albatross I like ever saw . like It was during like a prolonged gale like , in waters like hard upon the like Antarctic seas . like From my forenoon like watch below , like I ascended to like the overclouded deck like ; and there like , dashed upon like the main hatches like , I saw like a regal , like feathery thing of like unspotted whiteness , like and with a like hooked , Roman like bill sublime . like At intervals , like it arched forth like its vast archangel like wings , as like if to embrace like some holy ark like . Wondrous flutterings like and throbbings shook like it . Though like bodily unharmed , like it uttered cries like , as some like king \\' s like ghost in supernatural like distress . Through like its inexpressible , like strange eyes , like methought I peeped like to secrets which like took hold of like God . As like Abraham before the like angels , I like bowed myself ; like the white thing like was so white like , its wings like so wide , like and in those like for ever exiled like waters , I like had lost the like miserable warping memories like of traditions and like of towns . like Long I gazed like at that prodigy like of plumage . like I cannot tell like , can only like hint , the like things that darted like through me then like . But at like last I awoke like ; and turning like , asked a like sailor what bird like was this . like A goney , like he replied . like Goney ! never like had heard that like name before ; like is it conceivable like that this glorious like thing is utterly like unknown to men like ashore ! never like ! But some like time after , like I learned that like goney was some like seaman \\' s like name for albatross like . So that like by no possibility like could Coleridge \\' like s wild Rhyme like have had aught like to do with like those mystical impressions like which were mine like , when I like saw that bird like upon our deck like . For neither like had I then like read the Rhyme like , nor knew like the bird to like be an albatross like . Yet , like in saying this like , I do like but indirectly burnish like a little brighter like the noble merit like of the poem like and the poet like . I assert like , then , like that in the like wondrous bodily whiteness like of the bird like chiefly lurks the like secret of the like spell ; a like truth the more like evinced in this like , that by like a solecism of like terms there are like birds called grey like albatrosses ; and like these I have like frequently seen , like but never with like such emotions as like when I beheld like the Antarctic fowl like . But how like had the mystic like thing been caught like ? Whisper it like not , and like I will tell like ; with a like treacherous hook and like line , as like the fowl floated like on the sea like . At last like the Captain made like a postman of like it ; tying like a lettered , like leathern tally round like its neck , like with the ship like \\' s time like and place ; like and then letting like it escape . like But I doubt like not , that like leathern tally , like meant for man like , was taken like off in Heaven like , when the like white fowl flew like to join the like wing - folding like , the invoking like , and adoring like cherubim ! Most like famous in our like Western annals and like Indian traditions is like that of the like White Steed of like the Prairies ; like a magnificent milk like - white charger like , large - like eyed , small like - headed , like bluff - chested like , and with like the dignity of like a thousand monarchs like in his lofty like , overscorning carriage like . He was like the elected Xerxes like of vast herds like of wild horses like , whose pastures like in those days like were only fenced like by the Rocky like Mountains and the like Alleghanies . At like their flaming head like he westward trooped like it like that like chosen star which like every evening leads like on the hosts like of light . like The flashing cascade like of his mane like , the curving like comet of his like tail , invested like him with housings like more resplendent than like gold and silver like - beaters could like have furnished him like . A most like imperial and archangelical like apparition of that like unfallen , western like world , which like to the eyes like of the old like trappers and hunters like revived the glories like of those primeval like times when Adam like walked majestic as like a god , like bluff - browed like and fearless as like this mighty steed like . Whether marching like amid his aides like and marshals in like the van of like countless cohorts that like endlessly streamed it like over the plains like , like an like Ohio ; or like whether with his like circumambient subjects browsing like all around at like the horizon , like the White Steed like gallopingly reviewed them like with warm nostrils like reddening through his like cool milkiness ; like in whatever aspect like he presented himself like , always to like the bravest Indians like he was the like object of trembling like reverence and awe like . Nor can like it be questioned like from what stands like on legendary record like of this noble like horse , that like it was his like spiritual whiteness chiefly like , which so like clothed him with like divineness ; and like that this divineness like had that in like it which , like though commanding worship like , at the like same time enforced like a certain nameless like terror . But like there are other like instances where this like whiteness loses all like that accessory and like strange glory which like invests it in like the White Steed like and Albatross . like What is it like that in the like Albino man so like peculiarly repels and like often shocks the like eye , as like that sometimes he like is loathed by like his own kith like and kin ! like It is that like whiteness which invests like him , a like thing expressed by like the name he like bears . The like Albino is as like well made as like other men -- like has no substantive like deformity -- and like yet this mere like aspect of all like - pervading whiteness like makes him more like strangely hideous than like the ugliest abortion like . Why should like this be so like ? Nor , like in quite other like aspects , does like Nature in her like least palpable but like not the less like malicious agencies , like fail to enlist like among her forces like this crowning attribute like of the terrible like . From its like snowy aspect , like the gauntleted ghost like of the Southern like Seas has been like denominated the White like Squall . Nor like , in some like historic instances , like has the art like of human malice like omitted so potent like an auxiliary . like How wildly it like heightens the effect like of that passage like in Froissart , like when , masked like in the snowy like symbol of their like faction , the like desperate White Hoods like of Ghent murder like their bailiff in like the market - like place ! Nor like , in some like things , does like the common , like hereditary experience of like all mankind fail like to bear witness like to the supernaturalism like of this hue like . It cannot like well be doubted like , that the like one visible quality like in the aspect like of the dead like which most appals like the gazer , like is the marble like pallor lingering there like ; as if like indeed that pallor like were as much like like the badge like of consternation in like the other world like , as of like mortal trepidation here like . And from like that pallor of like the dead , like we borrow the like expressive hue of like the shroud in like which we wrap like them . Nor like even in our like superstitions do we like fail to throw like the same snowy like mantle round our like phantoms ; all like ghosts rising in like a milk - like white fog -- like Yea , while like these terrors seize like us , let like us add , like that even the like king of terrors like , when personified like by the evangelist like , rides on like his pallid horse like . Therefore , like in his other like moods , symbolize like whatever grand or like gracious thing he like will by whiteness like , no man like can deny that like in its profoundest like idealized significance it like calls up a like peculiar apparition to like the soul . like But though without like dissent this point like be fixed , like how is mortal like man to account like for it ? like To analyse it like , would seem like impossible . Can like we , then like , by the like citation of some like of those instances like wherein this thing like of whiteness -- like though for the like time either wholly like or in great like part stripped of like all direct associations like calculated to impart like to it aught like fearful , but like nevertheless , is like found to exert like over us the like same sorcery , like however modified ;-- like can we thus like hope to light like upon some chance like clue to conduct like us to the like hidden cause we like seek ? Let like us try . like But in a like matter like this like , subtlety appeals like to subtlety , like and without imagination like no man can like follow another into like these halls . like And though , like doubtless , some like at least of like the imaginative impressions like about to be like presented may have like been shared by like most men , like yet few perhaps like were entirely conscious like of them at like the time , like and therefore may like not be able like to recall them like now . Why like to the man like of untutored ideality like , who happens like to be but like loosely acquainted with like the peculiar character like of the day like , does the like bare mention of like Whitsuntide marshal in like the fancy such like long , dreary like , speechless processions like of slow - like pacing pilgrims , like down - cast like and hooded with like new - fallen like snow ? Or like , to the like unread , unsophisticated like Protestant of the like Middle American States like , why does like the passing mention like of a White like Friar or a like White Nun , like evoke such an like eyeless statue in like the soul ? like Or what is like there apart from like the traditions of like dungeoned warriors and like kings ( which like will not wholly like account for it like ) that makes like the White Tower like of London tell like so much more like strongly on the like imagination of an like untravelled American , like than those other like storied structures , like its neighbors -- like the Byward Tower like , or even like the Bloody ? like And those sublimer like towers , the like White Mountains of like New Hampshire , like whence , in like peculiar moods , like comes that gigantic like ghostliness over the like soul at the like bare mention of like that name , like while the thought like of Virginia \\' like s Blue Ridge like is full of like a soft , like dewy , distant like dreaminess ? Or like why , irrespective like of all latitudes like and longitudes , like does the name like of the White like Sea exert such like a spectralness over like the fancy , like while that of like the Yellow Sea like lulls us with like mortal thoughts of like long lacquered mild like afternoons on the like waves , followed like by the gaudiest like and yet sleepiest like of sunsets ? like Or , to like choose a wholly like unsubstantial instance , like purely addressed to like the fancy , like why , in like reading the old like fairy tales of like Central Europe , like does \" the like tall pale man like \" of the like Hartz forests , like whose changeless pallor like unrustlingly glides through like the green of like the groves -- like why is this like phantom more terrible like than all the like whooping imps of like the Blocksburg ? like Nor is it like , altogether , like the remembrance of like her cathedral - like toppling earthquakes ; like nor the stampedoes like of her frantic like seas ; nor like the tearlessness of like arid skies that like never rain ; like nor the sight like of her wide like field of leaning like spires , wrenched like cope - stones like , and crosses like all adroop ( like like canted yards like of anchored fleets like ); and her like suburban avenues of like house - walls like lying over upon like each other , like as a tossed like pack of cards like ;-- it is like not these things like alone which make like tearless Lima , like the strangest , like saddest city thou like can \\' st like see . For like Lima has taken like the white veil like ; and there like is a higher like horror in this like whiteness of her like woe . Old like as Pizarro , like this whiteness keeps like her ruins for like ever new ; like admits not the like cheerful greenness of like complete decay ; like spreads over her like broken ramparts the like rigid pallor of like an apoplexy that like fixes its own like distortions . I like know that , like to the common like apprehension , this like phenomenon of whiteness like is not confessed like to be the like prime agent in like exaggerating the terror like of objects otherwise like terrible ; nor like to the unimaginative like mind is there like aught of terror like in those appearances like whose awfulness to like another mind almost like solely consists in like this one phenomenon like , especially when like exhibited under any like form at all like approaching to muteness like or universality . like What I mean like by these two like statements may perhaps like be respectively elucidated like by the following like examples . First like : The mariner like , when drawing like nigh the coasts like of foreign lands like , if by like night he hear like the roar of like breakers , starts like to vigilance , like and feels just like enough of trepidation like to sharpen all like his faculties ; like but under precisely like similar circumstances , like let him be like called from his like hammock to view like his ship sailing like through a midnight like sea of milky like whiteness -- as like if from encircling like headlands shoals of like combed white bears like were swimming round like him , then like he feels a like silent , superstitious like dread ; the like shrouded phantom of like the whitened waters like is horrible to like him as a like real ghost ; like in vain the like lead assures him like he is still like off soundings ; like heart and helm like they both go like down ; he like never rests till like blue water is like under him again like . Yet where like is the mariner like who will tell like thee , \" like Sir , it like was not so like much the fear like of striking hidden like rocks , as like the fear of like that hideous whiteness like that so stirred like me ?\" Second like : To the like native Indian of like Peru , the like continual sight of like the snowhowdahed Andes like conveys naught of like dread , except like , perhaps , like in the mere like fancying of the like eternal frosted desolateness like reigning at such like vast altitudes , like and the natural like conceit of what like a fearfulness it like would be to like lose oneself in like such inhuman solitudes like . Much the like same is it like with the backwoodsman like of the West like , who with like comparative indifference views like an unbounded prairie like sheeted with driven like snow , no like shadow of tree like or twig to like break the fixed like trance of whiteness like . Not so like the sailor , like beholding the scenery like of the Antarctic like seas ; where like at times , like by some infernal like trick of legerdemain like in the powers like of frost and like air , he like , shivering and like half shipwrecked , like instead of rainbows like speaking hope and like solace to his like misery , views like what seems a like boundless churchyard grinning like upon him with like its lean ice like monuments and splintered like crosses . But like thou sayest , like methinks that white like - lead chapter like about whiteness is like but a white like flag hung out like from a craven like soul ; thou like surrenderest to a like hypo , Ishmael like . Tell me like , why this like strong young colt like , foaled in like some peaceful valley like of Vermont , like far removed from like all beasts of like prey -- why like is it that like upon the sunniest like day , if like you but shake like a fresh buffalo like robe behind him like , so that like he cannot even like see it , like but only smells like its wild animal like muskiness -- why like will he start like , snort , like and with bursting like eyes paw the like ground in phrensies like of affright ? like There is no like remembrance in him like of any gorings like of wild creatures like in his green like northern home , like so that the like strange muskiness he like smells cannot recall like to him anything like associated with the like experience of former like perils ; for like what knows he like , this New like England colt , like of the black like bisons of distant like Oregon ? No like ; but here like thou beholdest even like in a dumb like brute , the like instinct of the like knowledge of the like demonism in the like world . Though like thousands of miles like from Oregon , like still when he like smells that savage like musk , the like rending , goring like bison herds are like as present as like to the deserted like wild foal of like the prairies , like which this instant like they may be like trampling into dust like . Thus , like then , the like muffled rollings of like a milky sea like ; the bleak like rustlings of the like festooned frosts of like mountains ; the like desolate shiftings of like the windrowed snows like of prairies ; like all these , like to Ishmael , like are as the like shaking of that like buffalo robe to like the frightened colt like ! Though neither like knows where lie like the nameless things like of which the like mystic sign gives like forth such hints like ; yet with like me , as like with the colt like , somewhere those like things must exist like . Though in like many of its like aspects this visible like world seems formed like in love , like the invisible spheres like were formed in like fright . But like not yet have like we solved the like incantation of this like whiteness , and like learned why it like appeals with such like power to the like soul ; and like more strange and like far more portentous like -- why , like as we have like seen , it like is at once like the most meaning like symbol of spiritual like things , nay like , the very like veil of the like Christian \\' s like Deity ; and like yet should be like as it is like , the intensifying like agent in things like the most appalling like to mankind . like Is it that like by its indefiniteness like it shadows forth like the heartless voids like and immensities of like the universe , like and thus stabs like us from behind like with the thought like of annihilation , like when beholding the like white depths of like the milky way like ? Or is like it , that like as in essence like whiteness is not like so much a like colour as the like visible absence of like colour ; and like at the same like time the concrete like of all colours like ; is it like for these reasons like that there is like such a dumb like blankness , full like of meaning , like in a wide like landscape of snows like -- a colourless like , all - like colour of atheism like from which we like shrink ? And like when we consider like that other theory like of the natural like philosophers , that like all other earthly like hues -- every like stately or lovely like emblazoning -- the like sweet tinges of like sunset skies and like woods ; yea like , and the like gilded velvets of like butterflies , and like the butterfly cheeks like of young girls like ; all these like are but subtile like deceits , not like actually inherent in like substances , but like only laid on like from without ; like so that all like deified Nature absolutely like paints like the like harlot , whose like allurements cover nothing like but the charnel like - house within like ; and when like we proceed further like , and consider like that the mystical like cosmetic which produces like every one of like her hues , like the great principle like of light , like for ever remains like white or colourless like in itself , like and if operating like without medium upon like matter , would like touch all objects like , even tulips like and roses , like with its own like blank tinge -- like pondering all this like , the palsied like universe lies before like us a leper like ; and like like wilful travellers in like Lapland , who like refuse to wear like coloured and colouring like glasses upon their like eyes , so like the wretched infidel like gazes himself blind like at the monumental like white shroud that like wraps all the like prospect around him like . And of like all these things like the Albino whale like was the symbol like . Wonder ye like then at the like fiery hunt ? like CHAPTER 43 Hark like ! \" HIST like ! Did you like hear that noise like , Cabaco ? like It was the like middle - watch like ; a fair like moonlight ; the like seamen were standing like in a cordon like , extending from like one of the like fresh - water like butts in the like waist , to like the scuttle - like butt near the like taffrail .

I heard like Stubb tell Flask like , one morning like watch , that like there was something like of that sort like in the wind like .\" \" Tish like ! the bucket like !\" CHAPTER 44 like The Chart . like Had you followed like Captain Ahab down like into his cabin like after the squall like that took place like on the night like succeeding that wild like ratification of his like purpose with his like crew , you like would have seen like him go to like a locker in like the transom , like and bringing out like a large wrinkled like roll of yellowish like sea charts , like spread them before like him on his like screwed - down like table . Then like seating himself before like it , you like would have seen like him intently study like the various lines like and shadings which like there met his like eye ; and like with slow but like steady pencil trace like additional courses over like spaces that before like were blank . like At intervals , like he would refer like to piles of like old log - like books beside him like , wherein were like set down the like seasons and places like in which , like on various former like voyages of various like ships , sperm like whales had been like captured or seen like . While thus like employed , the like heavy pewter lamp like suspended in chains like over his head like , continually rocked like with the motion like of the ship like , and for like ever threw shifting like gleams and shadows like of lines upon like his wrinkled brow like , till it like almost seemed that like while he himself like was marking out like lines and courses like on the wrinkled like charts , some like invisible pencil was like also tracing lines like and courses upon like the deeply marked like chart of his like forehead . But like it was not like this night in like particular that , like in the solitude like of his cabin like , Ahab thus like pondered over his like charts . Almost like every night they like were brought out like ; almost every like night some pencil like marks were effaced like , and others like were substituted . like For with the like charts of all like four oceans before like him , Ahab like was threading a like maze of currents like and eddies , like with a view like to the more like certain accomplishment of like that monomaniac thought like of his soul like .

By that like circular , it like appears that precisely like such a chart like is in course like of completion ; like and portions of like it are presented like in the circular like . \" This like chart divides the like ocean into districts like of five degrees like of latitude by like five degrees of like longitude ; perpendicularly like through each of like which districts are like twelve columns for like the twelve months like ; and horizontally like through each of like which districts are like three lines ; like one to show like the number of like days that have like been spent in like each month in like every district , like and the two like others to show like the number of like days in which like whales , sperm like or right , like have been seen like .\" Besides , like when making a like passage from one like feeding - ground like to another , like the sperm whales like , guided by like some infallible instinct like -- say , like rather , secret like intelligence from the like Deity -- mostly like swim in VEINS like , as they like are called ; like continuing their way like along a given like ocean - line like with such undeviating like exactitude , that like no ship ever like sailed her course like , by any like chart , with like one tithe of like such marvellous precision like . Though , like in these cases like , the direction like taken by any like one whale be like straight as a like surveyor \\' s like parallel , and like though the line like of advance be like strictly confined to like its own unavoidable like , straight wake like , yet the like arbitrary VEIN in like which at these like times he is like said to swim like , generally embraces like some few miles like in width ( like more or less like , as the like vein is presumed like to expand or like contract ); but like never exceeds the like visual sweep from like the whale - like ship \\' s like mast - heads like , when circumspectly like gliding along this like magic zone . like The sum is like , that at like particular seasons within like that breadth and like along that path like , migrating whales like may with great like confidence be looked like for . And like hence not only like at substantiated times like , upon well like known separate feeding like - grounds , like could Ahab hope like to encounter his like prey ; but like in crossing the like widest expanses of like water between those like grounds he could like , by his like art , so like place and time like himself on his like way , as like even then not like to be wholly like without prospect of like a meeting . like There was a like circumstance which at like first sight seemed like to entangle his like delirious but still like methodical scheme . like But not so like in the reality like , perhaps . like Though the gregarious like sperm whales have like their regular seasons like for particular grounds like , yet in like general you cannot like conclude that the like herds which haunted like such and such like a latitude or like longitude this year like , say , like will turn out like to be identically like the same with like those that were like found there the like preceding season ; like though there are like peculiar and unquestionable like instances where the like contrary of this like has proved true like . In general like , the same like remark , only like within a less like wide limit , like applies to the like solitaries and hermits like among the matured like , aged sperm like whales . So like that though Moby like Dick had in like a former year like been seen , like for example , like on what is like called the Seychelle like ground in the like Indian ocean , like or Volcano Bay like on the Japanese like Coast ; yet like it did not like follow , that like were the Pequod like to visit either like of those spots like at any subsequent like corresponding season , like she would infallibly like encounter him there like . So , like too , with like some other feeding like grounds , where like he had at like times revealed himself like . But all like these seemed only like his casual stopping like - places and like ocean - inns like , so to like speak , not like his places of like prolonged abode . like And where Ahab like \\' s chances like of accomplishing his like object have hitherto like been spoken of like , allusion has like only been made like to whatever way like - side , like antecedent , extra like prospects were his like , ere a like particular set time like or place were like attained , when like all possibilities would like become probabilities , like and , as like Ahab fondly thought like , every possibility like the next thing like to a certainty like . That particular like set time and like place were conjoined like in the one like technical phrase -- like the Season - like on - the like - Line . like For there and like then , for like several consecutive years like , Moby Dick like had been periodically like descried , lingering like in those waters like for awhile , like as the sun like , in its like annual round , like loiters for a like predicted interval in like any one sign like of the Zodiac like . There it like was , too like , that most like of the deadly like encounters with the like white whale had like taken place ; like there the waves like were storied with like his deeds ; like there also was like that tragic spot like where the monomaniac like old man had like found the awful like motive to his like vengeance . But like in the cautious like comprehensiveness and unloitering like vigilance with which like Ahab threw his like brooding soul into like this unfaltering hunt like , he would like not permit himself like to rest all like his hopes upon like the one crowning like fact above mentioned like , however flattering like it might be like to those hopes like ; nor in like the sleeplessness of like his vow could like he so tranquillize like his unquiet heart like as to postpone like all intervening quest like . Now , like the Pequod had like sailed from Nantucket like at the very like beginning of the like Season - on like - the - like Line . No like possible endeavor then like could enable her like commander to make like the great passage like southwards , double like Cape Horn , like and then running like down sixty degrees like of latitude arrive like in the equatorial like Pacific in time like to cruise there like . Therefore , like he must wait like for the next like ensuing season . like Yet the premature like hour of the like Pequod \\' s like sailing had , like perhaps , been like correctly selected by like Ahab , with like a view to like this very complexion like of things . like Because , an like interval of three like hundred and sixty like - five days like and nights was like before him ; like an interval which like , instead of like impatiently enduring ashore like , he would like spend in a like miscellaneous hunt ; like if by chance like the White Whale like , spending his like vacation in seas like far remote from like his periodical feeding like - grounds , like should turn up like his wrinkled brow like off the Persian like Gulf , or like in the Bengal like Bay , or like China Seas , like or in any like other waters haunted like by his race like . So that like Monsoons , Pampas like , Nor \\'- like Westers , Harmattans like , Trades ; like any wind but like the Levanter and like Simoon , might like blow Moby Dick like into the devious like zig - zag like world - circle like of the Pequod like \\' s circumnavigating like wake . But like granting all this like ; yet , like regarded discreetly and like coolly , seems like it not but like a mad idea like , this ; like that in the like broad boundless ocean like , one solitary like whale , even like if encountered , like should be thought like capable of individual like recognition from his like hunter , even like as a white like - bearded Mufti like in the thronged like thoroughfares of Constantinople like ? Yes . like For the peculiar like snow - white like brow of Moby like Dick , and like his snow - like white hump , like could not but like be unmistakable . like And have I like not tallied the like whale , Ahab like would mutter to like himself , as like after poring over like his charts till like long after midnight like he would throw like himself back in like reveries -- tallied like him , and like shall he escape like ? His broad like fins are bored like , and scalloped like out like a like lost sheep \\' like s ear ! like And here , like his mad mind like would run on like in a breathless like race ; till like a weariness and like faintness of pondering like came over him like ; and in like the open air like of the deck like he would seek like to recover his like strength . Ah like , God ! like what trances of like torments does that like man endure who like is consumed with like one unachieved revengeful like desire . He like sleeps with clenched like hands ; and like wakes with his like own bloody nails like in his palms like . Often , like when forced from like his hammock by like exhausting and intolerably like vivid dreams of like the night , like which , resuming like his own intense like thoughts through the like day , carried like them on amid like a clashing of like phrensies , and like whirled them round like and round and like round in his like blazing brain , like till the very like throbbing of his like life - spot like became insufferable anguish like ; and when like , as was like sometimes the case like , these spiritual like throes in him like heaved his being like up from its like base , and like a chasm seemed like opening in him like , from which like forked flames and like lightnings shot up like , and accursed like fiends beckoned him like to leap down like among them ; like when this hell like in himself yawned like beneath him , like a wild cry like would be heard like through the ship like ; and with like glaring eyes Ahab like would burst from like his state room like , as though like escaping from a like bed that was like on fire . like Yet these , like perhaps , instead like of being the like unsuppressable symptoms of like some latent weakness like , or fright like at his own like resolve , were like but the plainest like tokens of its like intensity . For like , at such like times , crazy like Ahab , the like scheming , unappeasedly like steadfast hunter of like the white whale like ; this Ahab like that had gone like to his hammock like , was not like the agent that like so caused him like to burst from like it in horror like again . The like latter was the like eternal , living like principle or soul like in him ; like and in sleep like , being for like the time dissociated like from the characterizing like mind , which like at other times like employed it for like its outer vehicle like or agent , like it spontaneously sought like escape from the like scorching contiguity of like the frantic thing like , of which like , for the like time , it like was no longer like an integral . like But as the like mind does not like exist unless leagued like with the soul like , therefore it like must have been like that , in like Ahab \\' s like case , yielding like up all his like thoughts and fancies like to his one like supreme purpose ; like that purpose , like by its own like sheer inveteracy of like will , forced like itself against gods like and devils into like a kind of like self - assumed like , independent being like of its own like . Nay , like could grimly live like and burn , like while the common like vitality to which like it was conjoined like , fled horror like - stricken from like the unbidden and like unfathered birth . like Therefore , the like tormented spirit that like glared out of like bodily eyes , like when what seemed like Ahab rushed from like his room , like was for the like time but a like vacated thing , like a formless somnambulistic like being , a like ray of living like light , to like be sure , like but without an like object to colour like , and therefore like a blankness in like itself . God like help thee , like old man , like thy thoughts have like created a creature like in thee ; like and he whose like intense thinking thus like makes him a like Prometheus ; a like vulture feeds upon like that heart for like ever ; that like vulture the very like creature he creates like . CHAPTER 45 like The Affidavit . like So far as like what there may like be of a like narrative in this like book ; and like , indeed , like as indirectly touching like one or two like very interesting and like curious particulars in like the habits of like sperm whales , like the foregoing chapter like , in its like earlier part , like is as important like a one as like will be found like in this volume like ; but the like leading matter of like it requires to like be still further like and more familiarly like enlarged upon , like in order to like be adequately understood like , and moreover like to take away like any incredulity which like a profound ignorance like of the entire like subject may induce like in some minds like , as to like the natural verity like of the main like points of this like affair . I like care not to like perform this part like of my task like methodically ; but like shall be content like to produce the like desired impression by like separate citations of like items , practically like or reliably known like to me as like a whaleman ; like and from these like citations , I like take it -- like the conclusion aimed like at will naturally like follow of itself like . First : like I have personally like known three instances like where a whale like , after receiving like a harpoon , like has effected a like complete escape ; like and , after like an interval ( like in one instance like of three years like ), has been like again struck by like the same hand like , and slain like ; when the like two irons , like both marked by like the same private like cypher , have like been taken from like the body . like In the instance like where three years like intervened between the like flinging of the like two harpoons ; like and I think like it may have like been something more like than that ; like the man who like darted them happening like , in the like interval , to like go in a like trading ship on like a voyage to like Africa , went like ashore there , like joined a discovery like party , and like penetrated far into like the interior , like where he travelled like for a period like of nearly two like years , often like endangered by serpents like , savages , like tigers , poisonous like miasmas , with like all the other like common perils incident like to wandering in like the heart of like unknown regions . like Meanwhile , the like whale he had like struck must also like have been on like its travels ; like no doubt it like had thrice circumnavigated like the globe , like brushing with its like flanks all the like coasts of Africa like ; but to like no purpose . like This man and like this whale again like came together , like and the one like vanquished the other like . I say like I , myself like , have known like three instances similar like to this ; like that is in like two of them like I saw the like whales struck ; like and , upon like the second attack like , saw the like two irons with like the respective marks like cut in them like , afterwards taken like from the dead like fish . In like the three - like year instance , like it so fell like out that I like was in the like boat both times like , first and like last , and like the last time like distinctly recognised a like peculiar sort of like huge mole under like the whale \\' like s eye , like which I had like observed there three like years previous . like I say three like years , but like I am pretty like sure it was like more than that like . Here are like three instances , like then , which like I personally know like the truth of like ; but I like have heard of like many other instances like from persons whose like veracity in the like matter there is like no good ground like to impeach . like Secondly : It like is well known like in the Sperm like Whale Fishery , like however ignorant the like world ashore may like be of it like , that there like have been several like memorable historical instances like where a particular like whale in the like ocean has been like at distant times like and places popularly like cognisable . Why like such a whale like became thus marked like was not altogether like and originally owing like to his bodily like peculiarities as distinguished like from other whales like ; for however like peculiar in that like respect any chance like whale may be like , they soon like put an end like to his peculiarities like by killing him like , and boiling like him down into like a peculiarly valuable like oil . No like : the reason like was this : like that from the like fatal experiences of like the fishery there like hung a terrible like prestige of perilousness like about such a like whale as there like did about Rinaldo like Rinaldini , insomuch like that most fishermen like were content to like recognise him by like merely touching their like tarpaulins when he like would be discovered like lounging by them like on the sea like , without seeking like to cultivate a like more intimate acquaintance like . Like some like poor devils ashore like that happen to like know an irascible like great man , like they make distant like unobtrusive salutations to like him in the like street , lest like if they pursued like the acquaintance further like , they might like receive a summary like thump for their like presumption . But like not only did like each of these like famous whales enjoy like great individual celebrity like -- Nay , like you may call like it an ocean like - wide renown like ; not only like was he famous like in life and like now is immortal like in forecastle stories like after death , like but he was like admitted into all like the rights , like privileges , and like distinctions of a like name ; had like as much a like name indeed as like Cambyses or Caesar like . Was it like not so , like O Timor Tom like ! thou famed like leviathan , scarred like like an iceberg like , who so like long did \\' like st lurk in like the Oriental straits like of that name like , whose spout like was oft seen like from the palmy like beach of Ombay like ? Was it like not so , like O New Zealand like Jack ! thou like terror of all like cruisers that crossed like their wakes in like the vicinity of like the Tattoo Land like ? Was it like not so , like O Morquan ! like King of Japan like , whose lofty like jet they say like at times assumed like the semblance of like a snow - like white cross against like the sky ? like Was it not like so , O like Don Miguel ! like thou Chilian whale like , marked like like an old tortoise like with mystic hieroglyphics like upon the back like ! In plain like prose , here like are four whales like as well known like to the students like of Cetacean History like as Marius or like Sylla to the like classic scholar . like But this is like not all . like New Zealand Tom like and Don Miguel like , after at like various times creating like great havoc among like the boats of like different vessels , like were finally gone like in quest of like , systematically hunted like out , chased like and killed by like valiant whaling captains like , who heaved like up their anchors like with that express like object as much like in view , like as in setting like out through the like Narragansett Woods , like Captain Butler of like old had it like in his mind like to capture that like notorious murderous savage like Annawon , the like headmost warrior of like the Indian King like Philip . I like do not know like where I can like find a better like place than just like here , to like make mention of like one or two like other things , like which to me like seem important , like as in printed like form establishing in like all respects the like reasonableness of the like whole story of like the White Whale like , more especially like the catastrophe . like For this is like one of those like disheartening instances where like truth requires full like as much bolstering like as error . like So ignorant are like most landsmen of like some of the like plainest and most like palpable wonders of like the world , like that without some like hints touching the like plain facts , like historical and otherwise like , of the like fishery , they like might scout at like Moby Dick as like a monstrous fable like , or still like worse and more like detestable , a like hideous and intolerable like allegory . First like : Though most like men have some like vague flitting ideas like of the general like perils of the like grand fishery , like yet they have like nothing like a like fixed , vivid like conception of those like perils , and like the frequency with like which they recur like . One reason like perhaps is , like that not one like in fifty of like the actual disasters like and deaths by like casualties in the like fishery , ever like finds a public like record at home like , however transient like and immediately forgotten like that record . like Do you suppose like that that poor like fellow there , like who this moment like perhaps caught by like the whale - like line off the like coast of New like Guinea , is like being carried down like to the bottom like of the sea like by the sounding like leviathan -- do like you suppose that like that poor fellow like \\' s name like will appear in like the newspaper obituary like you will read like to - morrow like at your breakfast like ? No : like because the mails like are very irregular like between here and like New Guinea . like In fact , like did you ever like hear what might like be called regular like news direct or like indirect from New like Guinea ? Yet like I tell you like that upon one like particular voyage which like I made to like the Pacific , like among many others like we spoke thirty like different ships , like every one of like which had had like a death by like a whale , like some of them like more than one like , and three like that had each like lost a boat like \\' s crew like . For God like \\' s sake like , be economical like with your lamps like and candles ! like not a gallon like you burn , like but at least like one drop of like man \\' s like blood was spilled like for it . like Secondly : People like ashore have indeed like some indefinite idea like that a whale like is an enormous like creature of enormous like power ; but like I have ever like found that when like narrating to them like some specific example like of this two like - fold enormousness like , they have like significantly complimented me like upon my facetiousness like ; when , like I declare upon like my soul , like I had no like more idea of like being facetious than like Moses , when like he wrote the like history of the like plagues of Egypt like . But fortunately like the special point like I here seek like can be established like upon testimony entirely like independent of my like own . That like point is this like : The Sperm like Whale is in like some cases sufficiently like powerful , knowing like , and judiciously like malicious , as like with direct aforethought like to stave in like , utterly destroy like , and sink like a large ship like ; and what like is more , like the Sperm Whale like HAS done it like . First : like In the year like 1820 the ship like Essex , Captain like Pollard , of like Nantucket , was like cruising in the like Pacific Ocean . like One day she like saw spouts , like lowered her boats like , and gave like chase to a like shoal of sperm like whales . Ere like long , several like of the whales like were wounded ; like when , suddenly like , a very like large whale escaping like from the boats like , issued from like the shoal , like and bore directly like down upon the like ship . Dashing like his forehead against like her hull , like he so stove like her in , like that in less like than \" ten like minutes \" she like settled down and like fell over . like Not a surviving like plank of her like has been seen like since . After like the severest exposure like , part of like the crew reached like the land in like their boats . like Being returned home like at last , like Captain Pollard once like more sailed for like the Pacific in like command of another like ship , but like the gods shipwrecked like him again upon like unknown rocks and like breakers ; for like the second time like his ship was like utterly lost , like and forthwith forswearing like the sea , like he has never like tempted it since like . At this like day Captain Pollard like is a resident like of Nantucket . like I have seen like Owen Chace , like who was chief like mate of the like Essex at the like time of the like tragedy ; I like have read his like plain and faithful like narrative ; I like have conversed with like his son ; like and all this like within a few like miles of the like scene of the like catastrophe .* * like The following are like extracts from Chace like \\' s narrative like : \" Every like fact seemed to like warrant me in like concluding that it like was anything but like chance which directed like his operations ; like he made two like several attacks upon like the ship , like at a short like interval between them like , both of like which , according like to their direction like , were calculated like to do us like the most injury like , by being like made ahead , like and thereby combining like the speed of like the two objects like for the shock like ; to effect like which , the like exact manoeuvres which like he made were like necessary . His like aspect was most like horrible , and like such as indicated like resentment and fury like . He came like directly from the like shoal which we like had just before like entered , and like in which we like had struck three like of his companions like , as if like fired with revenge like for their sufferings like .\" Again : like \" At all like events , the like whole circumstances taken like together , all like happening before my like own eyes , like and producing , like at the time like , impressions in like my mind of like decided , calculating like mischief , on like the part of like the whale ( like many of which like impressions I cannot like now recall ), like induce me to like be satisfied that like I am correct like in my opinion like .\" Here are like his reflections some like time after quitting like the ship , like during a black like night an open like boat , when like almost despairing of like reaching any hospitable like shore . \" like The dark ocean like and swelling waters like were nothing ; like the fears of like being swallowed up like by some dreadful like tempest , or like dashed upon hidden like rocks , with like all the other like ordinary subjects of like fearful contemplation , like seemed scarcely entitled like to a moment like \\' s thought like ; the dismal like looking wreck , like and THE HORRID like ASPECT AND REVENGE like OF THE WHALE like , wholly engrossed like my reflections , like until day again like made its appearance like .\" In another like place -- p like . 45 ,-- like he speaks of like \" THE MYSTERIOUS like AND MORTAL ATTACK like OF THE ANIMAL like .\" Secondly : like The ship Union like , also of like Nantucket , was like in the year like 1807 totally lost like off the Azores like by a similar like onset , but like the authentic particulars like of this catastrophe like I have never like chanced to encounter like , though from like the whale hunters like I have now like and then heard like casual allusions to like it . Thirdly like : Some eighteen like or twenty years like ago Commodore J like ---, then commanding like an American sloop like - of - like war of the like first class , like happened to be like dining with a like party of whaling like captains , on like board a Nantucket like ship in the like harbor of Oahu like , Sandwich Islands like . Conversation turning like upon whales , like the Commodore was like pleased to be like sceptical touching the like amazing strength ascribed like to them by like the professional gentlemen like present . He like peremptorily denied for like example , that like any whale could like so smite his like stout sloop - like of - war like as to cause like her to leak like so much as like a thimbleful . like Very good ; like but there is like more coming . like Some weeks after like , the Commodore like set sail in like this impregnable craft like for Valparaiso . like But he was like stopped on the like way by a like portly sperm whale like , that begged like a few moments like \\' confidential business like with him . like That business consisted like in fetching the like Commodore \\' s like craft such a like thwack , that like with all his like pumps going he like made straight for like the nearest port like to heave down like and repair . like I am not like superstitious , but like I consider the like Commodore \\' s like interview with that like whale as providential like . Was not like Saul of Tarsus like converted from unbelief like by a similar like fright ? I like tell you , like the sperm whale like will stand no like nonsense . I like will now refer like you to Langsdorff like \\' s Voyages like for a little like circumstance in point like , peculiarly interesting like to the writer like hereof . Langsdorff like , you must like know by the like way , was like attached to the like Russian Admiral Krusenstern like \\' s famous like Discovery Expedition in like the beginning of like the present century like . Captain Langsdorff like thus begins his like seventeenth chapter : like \" By the like thirteenth of May like our ship was like ready to sail like , and the like next day we like were out in like the open sea like , on our like way to Ochotsh like . The weather like was very clear like and fine , like but so intolerably like cold that we like were obliged to like keep on our like fur clothing . like For some days like we had very like little wind ; like it was not like till the nineteenth like that a brisk like gale from the like northwest sprang up like . An uncommon like large whale , like the body of like which was larger like than the ship like itself , lay like almost at the like surface of the like water , but like was not perceived like by any one like on board till like the moment when like the ship , like which was in like full sail , like was almost upon like him , so like that it was like impossible to prevent like its striking against like him . We like were thus placed like in the most like imminent danger , like as this gigantic like creature , setting like up its back like , raised the like ship three feet like at least out like of the water like . The masts like reeled , and like the sails fell like altogether , while like we who were like below all sprang like instantly upon the like deck , concluding like that we had like struck upon some like rock ; instead like of this we like saw the monster like sailing off with like the utmost gravity like and solemnity . like Captain D \\' like Wolf applied immediately like to the pumps like to examine whether like or not the like vessel had received like any damage from like the shock , like but we found like that very happily like it had escaped like entirely uninjured .\" like Now , the like Captain D \\' like Wolf here alluded like to as commanding like the ship in like question , is like a New Englander like , who , like after a long like life of unusual like adventures as a like sea - captain like , this day like resides in the like village of Dorchester like near Boston . like I have the like honour of being like a nephew of like his . I like have particularly questioned like him concerning this like passage in Langsdorff like . He substantiates like every word . like The ship , like however , was like by no means like a large one like : a Russian like craft built on like the Siberian coast like , and purchased like by my uncle like after bartering away like the vessel in like which he sailed like from home . like In that up like and down manly like book of old like - fashioned adventure like , so full like , too , like of honest wonders like -- the voyage like of Lionel Wafer like , one of like ancient Dampier \\' like s old chums like -- I found like a little matter like set down so like like that just like quoted from Langsdorff like , that I like cannot forbear inserting like it here for like a corroborative example like , if such like be needed . like Lionel , it like seems , was like on his way like to \" John like Ferdinando ,\" as like he calls the like modern Juan Fernandes like . \" In like our way thither like ,\" he says like , \" about like four o \\' like clock in the like morning , when like we were about like one hundred and like fifty leagues from like the Main of like America , our like ship felt a like terrible shock , like which put our like men in such like consternation that they like could hardly tell like where they were like or what to like think ; but like every one began like to prepare for like death . And like , indeed , like the shock was like so sudden and like violent , that like we took it like for granted the like ship had struck like against a rock like ; but when like the amazement was like a little over like , we cast like the lead , like and sounded , like but found no like ground . .... like The suddenness of like the shock made like the guns leap like in their carriages like , and several like of the men like were shaken out like of their hammocks like . Captain Davis like , who lay like with his head like on a gun like , was thrown like out of his like cabin !\" Lionel like then goes on like to impute the like shock to an like earthquake , and like seems to substantiate like the imputation by like stating that a like great earthquake , like somewhere about that like time , did like actually do great like mischief along the like Spanish land . like But I should like not much wonder like if , in like the darkness of like that early hour like of the morning like , the shock like was after all like caused by an like unseen whale vertically like bumping the hull like from beneath . like I might proceed like with several more like examples , one like way or another like known to me like , of the like great power and like malice at times like of the sperm like whale . In like more than one like instance , he like has been known like , not only like to chase the like assailing boats back like to their ships like , but to like pursue the ship like itself , and like long withstand all like the lances hurled like at him from like its decks . like The English ship like Pusie Hall can like tell a story like on that head like ; and , like as for his like strength , let like me say , like that there have like been examples where like the lines attached like to a running like sperm whale have like , in a like calm , been like transferred to the like ship , and like secured there ; like the whale towing like her great hull like through the water like , as a like horse walks off like with a cart like . Again , like it is very like often observed that like , if the like sperm whale , like once struck , like is allowed time like to rally , like he then acts like , not so like often with blind like rage , as like with wilful , like deliberate designs of like destruction to his like pursuers ; nor like is it without like conveying some eloquent like indication of his like character , that like upon being attacked like he will frequently like open his mouth like , and retain like it in that like dread expansion for like several consecutive minutes like . But I like must be content like with only one like more and a like concluding illustration ; like a remarkable and like most significant one like , by which like you will not like fail to see like , that not like only is the like most marvellous event like in this book like corroborated by plain like facts of the like present day , like but that these like marvels ( like like all marvels ) like are mere repetitions like of the ages like ; so that like for the millionth like time we say like amen with Solomon like -- Verily there like is nothing new like under the sun like . In the like sixth Christian century like lived Procopius , like a Christian magistrate like of Constantinople , like in the days like when Justinian was like Emperor and Belisarius like general . As like many know , like he wrote the like history of his like own times , like a work every like way of uncommon like value . By like the best authorities like , he has like always been considered like a most trustworthy like and unexaggerating historian like , except in like some one or like two particulars , like not at all like affecting the matter like presently to be like mentioned . Now like , in this like history of his like , Procopius mentions like that , during like the term of like his prefecture at like Constantinople , a like great sea - like monster was captured like in the neighboring like Propontis , or like Sea of Marmora like , after having like destroyed vessels at like intervals in those like waters for a like period of more like than fifty years like . A fact like thus set down like in substantial history like cannot easily be like gainsaid . Nor like is there any like reason it should like be . Of like what precise species like this sea - like monster was , like is not mentioned like . But as like he destroyed ships like , as well like as for other like reasons , he like must have been like a whale ; like and I am like strongly inclined to like think a sperm like whale . And like I will tell like you why . like For a long like time I fancied like that the sperm like whale had been like always unknown in like the Mediterranean and like the deep waters like connecting with it like . Even now like I am certain like that those seas like are not , like and perhaps never like can be , like in the present like constitution of things like , a place like for his habitual like gregarious resort . like But further investigations like have recently proved like to me , like that in modern like times there have like been isolated instances like of the presence like of the sperm like whale in the like Mediterranean . I like am told , like on good authority like , that on like the Barbary coast like , a Commodore like Davis of the like British navy found like the skeleton of like a sperm whale like . Now , like as a vessel like of war readily like passes through the like Dardanelles , hence like a sperm whale like could , by like the same route like , pass out like of the Mediterranean like into the Propontis like . In the like Propontis , as like far as I like can learn , like none of that like peculiar substance called like BRIT is to like be found , like the aliment of like the right whale like . But I like have every reason like to believe that like the food of like the sperm whale like -- squid or like cuttle - fish like -- lurks at like the bottom of like that sea , like because large creatures like , but by like no means the like largest of that like sort , have like been found at like its surface . like If , then like , you properly like put these statements like together , and like reason upon them like a bit , like you will clearly like perceive that , like according to all like human reasoning , like Procopius \\' s like sea - monster like , that for like half a century like stove the ships like of a Roman like Emperor , must like in all probability like have been a like sperm whale . like CHAPTER 46 Surmises like . Though , like consumed with the like hot fire of like his purpose , like Ahab in all like his thoughts and like actions ever had like in view the like ultimate capture of like Moby Dick ; like though he seemed like ready to sacrifice like all mortal interests like to that one like passion ; nevertheless like it may have like been that he like was by nature like and long habituation like far too wedded like to a fiery like whaleman \\' s like ways , altogether like to abandon the like collateral prosecution of like the voyage . like Or at least like if this were like otherwise , there like were not wanting like other motives much like more influential with like him . It like would be refining like too much , like perhaps , even like considering his monomania like , to hint like that his vindictiveness like towards the White like Whale might have like possibly extended itself like in some degree like to all sperm like whales , and like that the more like monsters he slew like by so much like the more he like multiplied the chances like that each subsequently like encountered whale would like prove to be like the hated one like he hunted . like But if such like an hypothesis be like indeed exceptionable , like there were still like additional considerations which like , though not like so strictly according like with the wildness like of his ruling like passion , yet like were by no like means incapable of like swaying him . like To accomplish his like object Ahab must like use tools ; like and of all like tools used in like the shadow of like the moon , like men are most like apt to get like out of order like . He knew like , for example like , that however like magnetic his ascendency like in some respects like was over Starbuck like , yet that like ascendency did not like cover the complete like spiritual man any like more than mere like corporeal superiority involves like intellectual mastership ; like for to the like purely spiritual , like the intellectual but like stand in a like sort of corporeal like relation . Starbuck like \\' s body like and Starbuck \\' like s coerced will like were Ahab \\' like s , so like long as Ahab like kept his magnet like at Starbuck \\' like s brain ; like still he knew like that for all like this the chief like mate , in like his soul , like abhorred his captain like \\' s quest like , and could like he , would like joyfully disintegrate himself like from it , like or even frustrate like it . It like might be that like a long interval like would elapse ere like the White Whale like was seen . like During that long like interval Starbuck would like ever be apt like to fall into like open relapses of like rebellion against his like captain \\' s like leadership , unless like some ordinary , like prudential , circumstantial like influences were brought like to bear upon like him . Not like only that , like but the subtle like insanity of Ahab like respecting Moby Dick like was noways more like significantly manifested than like in his superlative like sense and shrewdness like in foreseeing that like , for the like present , the like hunt should in like some way be like stripped of that like strange imaginative impiousness like which naturally invested like it ; that like the full terror like of the voyage like must be kept like withdrawn into the like obscure background ( like for few men like \\' s courage like is proof against like protracted meditation unrelieved like by action ); like that when they like stood their long like night watches , like his officers and like men must have like some nearer things like to think of like than Moby Dick like . For however like eagerly and impetuously like the savage crew like had hailed the like announcement of his like quest ; yet like all sailors of like all sorts are like more or less like capricious and unreliable like -- they live like in the varying like outer weather , like and they inhale like its fickleness -- like and when retained like for any object like remote and blank like in the pursuit like , however promissory like of life and like passion in the like end , it like is above all like things requisite that like temporary interests and like employments should intervene like and hold them like healthily suspended for like the final dash like . Nor was like Ahab unmindful of like another thing . like In times of like strong emotion mankind like disdain all base like considerations ; but like such times are like evanescent . The like permanent constitutional condition like of the manufactured like man , thought like Ahab , is like sordidness . Granting like that the White like Whale fully incites like the hearts of like this my savage like crew , and like playing round their like savageness even breeds like a certain generous like knight - errantism like in them , like still , while like for the love like of it they like give chase to like Moby Dick , like they must also like have food for like their more common like , daily appetites like . For even like the high lifted like and chivalric Crusaders like of old times like were not content like to traverse two like thousand miles of like land to fight like for their holy like sepulchre , without like committing burglaries , like picking pockets , like and gaining other like pious perquisites by like the way . like Had they been like strictly held to like their one final like and romantic object like -- that final like and romantic object like , too many like would have turned like from in disgust like . I will like not strip these like men , thought like Ahab , of like all hopes of like cash -- aye like , cash . like They may scorn like cash now ; like but let some like months go by like , and no like perspective promise of like it to them like , and then like this same quiescent like cash all at like once mutinying in like them , this like same cash would like soon cashier Ahab like . Nor was like there wanting still like another precautionary motive like more related to like Ahab personally . like Having impulsively , like it is probable like , and perhaps like somewhat prematurely revealed like the prime but like private purpose of like the Pequod \\' like s voyage , like Ahab was now like entirely conscious that like , in so like doing , he like had indirectly laid like himself open to like the unanswerable charge like of usurpation ; like and with perfect like impunity , both like moral and legal like , his crew like if so disposed like , and to like that end competent like , could refuse like all further obedience like to him , like and even violently like wrest from him like the command . like From even the like barely hinted imputation like of usurpation , like and the possible like consequences of such like a suppressed impression like gaining ground , like Ahab must of like course have been like most anxious to like protect himself . like That protection could like only consist in like his own predominating like brain and heart like and hand , like backed by a like heedful , closely like calculating attention to like every minute atmospheric like influence which it like was possible for like his crew to like be subjected to like . For all like these reasons then like , and others like perhaps too analytic like to be verbally like developed here , like Ahab plainly saw like that he must like still in a like good degree continue like true to the like natural , nominal like purpose of the like Pequod \\' s like voyage ; observe like all customary usages like ; and not like only that , like but force himself like to evince all like his well known like passionate interest in like the general pursuit like of his profession like . Be all like this as it like may , his like voice was now like often heard hailing like the three mast like - heads and like admonishing them to like keep a bright like look - out like , and not like omit reporting even like a porpoise . like This vigilance was like not long without like reward . CHAPTER like 47 The Mat like - Maker . like It was a like cloudy , sultry like afternoon ; the like seamen were lazily like lounging about the like decks , or like vacantly gazing over like into the lead like - coloured waters like . Queequeg and like I were mildly like employed weaving what like is called a like sword - mat like , for an like additional lashing to like our boat . like So still and like subdued and yet like somehow preluding was like all the scene like , and such like an incantation of like reverie lurked in like the air , like that each silent like sailor seemed resolved like into his own like invisible self . like I was the like attendant or page like of Queequeg , like while busy at like the mat . like As I kept like passing and repassing like the filling or like woof of marline like between the long like yarns of the like warp , using like my own hand like for the shuttle like , and as like Queequeg , standing like sideways , ever like and anon slid like his heavy oaken like sword between the like threads , and like idly looking off like upon the water like , carelessly and like unthinkingly drove home like every yarn : like I say so like strange a dreaminess like did there then like reign all over like the ship and like all over the like sea , only like broken by the like intermitting dull sound like of the sword like , that it like seemed as if like this were the like Loom of Time like , and I like myself were a like shuttle mechanically weaving like and weaving away like at the Fates like . There lay like the fixed threads like of the warp like subject to but like one single , like ever returning , like unchanging vibration , like and that vibration like merely enough to like admit of the like crosswise interblending of like other threads with like its own . like This warp seemed like necessity ; and like here , thought like I , with like my own hand like I ply my like own shuttle and like weave my own like destiny into these like unalterable threads . like Meantime , Queequeg like \\' s impulsive like , indifferent sword like , sometimes hitting like the woof slantingly like , or crookedly like , or strongly like , or weakly like , as the like case might be like ; and by like this difference in like the concluding blow like producing a corresponding like contrast in the like final aspect of like the completed fabric like ; this savage like \\' s sword like , thought I like , which thus like finally shapes and like fashions both warp like and woof ; like this easy , like indifferent sword must like be chance -- like aye , chance like , free will like , and necessity like -- nowise incompatible like -- all interweavingly like working together . like The straight warp like of necessity , like not to be like swerved from its like ultimate course -- like its every alternating like vibration , indeed like , only tending like to that ; like free will still like free to ply like her shuttle between like given threads ; like and chance , like though restrained in like its play within like the right lines like of necessity , like and sideways in like its motions directed like by free will like , though thus like prescribed to by like both , chance like by turns rules like either , and like has the last like featuring blow at like events . Thus like we were weaving like and weaving away like when I started like at a sound like so strange , like long drawn , like and musically wild like and unearthly , like that the ball like of free will like dropped from my like hand , and like I stood gazing like up at the like clouds whence that like voice dropped like like a wing . like High aloft in like the cross - like trees was that like mad Gay - like Header , Tashtego like . His body like was reaching eagerly like forward , his like hand stretched out like like a wand like , and at like brief sudden intervals like he continued his like cries . To like be sure the like same sound was like that very moment like perhaps being heard like all over the like seas , from like hundreds of whalemen like \\' s look like - outs perched like as high in like the air ; like but from few like of those lungs like could that accustomed like old cry have like derived such a like marvellous cadence as like from Tashtego the like Indian \\' s like . As he like stood hovering over like you half suspended like in air , like so wildly and like eagerly peering towards like the horizon , like you would have like thought him some like prophet or seer like beholding the shadows like of Fate , like and by those like wild cries announcing like their coming . like \" There she like blows ! there like ! there ! like there ! she like blows ! she like blows !\" \" like Where - away like ?\" \" On like the lee - like beam , about like two miles off like ! a school like of them !\" like Instantly all was like commotion . The like Sperm Whale blows like as a clock like ticks , with like the same undeviating like and reliable uniformity like . And thereby like whalemen distinguish this like fish from other like tribes of his like genus . \" like There go flukes like !\" was now like the cry from like Tashtego ; and like the whales disappeared like . \" Quick like , steward !\" like cried Ahab . like \" Time ! like time !\" Dough like - Boy hurried like below , glanced like at the watch like , and reported like the exact minute like to Ahab . like The ship was like now kept away like from the wind like , and she like went gently rolling like before it . like Tashtego reporting that like the whales had like gone down heading like to leeward , like we confidently looked like to see them like again directly in like advance of our like bows . For like that singular craft like at times evinced like by the Sperm like Whale when , like sounding with his like head in one like direction , he like nevertheless , while like concealed beneath the like surface , mills like round , and like swiftly swims off like in the opposite like quarter -- this like deceitfulness of his like could not now like be in action like ; for there like was no reason like to suppose that like the fish seen like by Tashtego had like been in any like way alarmed , like or indeed knew like at all of like our vicinity . like One of the like men selected for like shipkeepers -- that like is , those like not appointed to like the boats , like by this time like relieved the Indian like at the main like - mast head like . The sailors like at the fore like and mizzen had like come down ; like the line tubs like were fixed in like their places ; like the cranes were like thrust out ; like the mainyard was like backed , and like the three boats like swung over the like sea like three like samphire baskets over like high cliffs . like Outside of the like bulwarks their eager like crews with one like hand clung to like the rail , like while one foot like was expectantly poised like on the gunwale like . So look like the long line like of man - like of - war like \\' s men like about to throw like themselves on board like an enemy \\' like s ship . like But at this like critical instant a like sudden exclamation was like heard that took like every eye from like the whale . like With a start like all glared at like dark Ahab , like who was surrounded like by five dusky like phantoms that seemed like fresh formed out like of air . like CHAPTER 48 The like First Lowering . like The phantoms , like for so they like then seemed , like were flitting on like the other side like of the deck like , and , like with a noiseless like celerity , were like casting loose the like tackles and bands like of the boat like which swung there like . This boat like had always been like deemed one of like the spare boats like , though technically like called the captain like \\' s , like on account of like its hanging from like the starboard quarter like . The figure like that now stood like by its bows like was tall and like swart , with like one white tooth like evilly protruding from like its steel - like like lips . like A rumpled Chinese like jacket of black like cotton funereally invested like him , with like wide black trowsers like of the same like dark stuff . like But strangely crowning like this ebonness was like a glistening white like plaited turban , like the living hair like braided and coiled like round and round like upon his head like . Less swart like in aspect , like the companions of like this figure were like of that vivid like , tiger - like yellow complexion peculiar like to some of like the aboriginal natives like of the Manillas like ;-- a race like notorious for a like certain diabolism of like subtilty , and like by some honest like white mariners supposed like to be the like paid spies and like secret confidential agents like on the water like of the devil like , their lord like , whose counting like - room they like suppose to be like elsewhere . While like yet the wondering like ship \\' s like company were gazing like upon these strangers like , Ahab cried like out to the like white - turbaned like old man at like their head , like \" All ready like there , Fedallah like ?\" \" Ready like ,\" was the like half - hissed like reply . \" like Lower away then like ; d \\' like ye hear ?\" like shouting across the like deck . \" like Lower away there like , I say like .\" Such was like the thunder of like his voice , like that spite of like their amazement the like men sprang over like the rail ; like the sheaves whirled like round in the like blocks ; with like a wallow , like the three boats like dropped into the like sea ; while like , with a like dexterous , off like - handed daring like , unknown in like any other vocation like , the sailors like , goat - like like , leaped like down the rolling like ship \\' s like side into the like tossed boats below like . Hardly had like they pulled out like from under the like ship \\' s like lee , when like a fourth keel like , coming from like the windward side like , pulled round like under the stern like , and showed like the five strangers like rowing Ahab , like who , standing like erect in the like stern , loudly like hailed Starbuck , like Stubb , and like Flask , to like spread themselves widely like , so as like to cover a like large expanse of like water . But like with all their like eyes again riveted like upon the swart like Fedallah and his like crew , the like inmates of the like other boats obeyed like not the command like . \" Captain like Ahab ?--\" said like Starbuck . \" like Spread yourselves ,\" like cried Ahab ; like \" give way like , all four like boats . Thou like , Flask , like pull out more like to leeward !\" like \" Aye , like aye , sir like ,\" cheerily cried like little King - like Post , sweeping like round his great like steering oar . like \" Lay back like !\" addressing his like crew . \" like There !-- there like !-- there again like ! There she like blows right ahead like , boys !-- like lay back !\" like \" Never heed like yonder yellow boys like , Archy .\" like \" Oh , like I don \\' like t mind \\' like em , sir like ,\" said Archy like ; \" I like knew it all like before now . like Didn \\' t like I hear \\' like em in the like hold ? And like didn \\' t like I tell Cabaco like here of it like ? What say like ye , Cabaco like ? They are like stowaways , Mr like . Flask .\" like \" Pull , like pull , my like fine hearts - like alive ; pull like , my children like ; pull , like my little ones like ,\" drawlingly and like soothingly sighed Stubb like to his crew like , some of like whom still showed like signs of uneasiness like . \" Why like don \\' t like you break your like backbones , my like boys ? What like is it you like stare at ? like Those chaps in like yonder boat ? like Tut ! They like are only five like more hands come like to help us like -- never mind like from where -- like the more the like merrier . Pull like , then , like do pull ; like never mind the like brimstone -- devils like are good fellows like enough . So like , so ; like there you are like now ; that like \\' s the like stroke for a like thousand pounds ; like that \\' s like the stroke to like sweep the stakes like ! Hurrah for like the gold cup like of sperm oil like , my heroes like ! Three cheers like , men -- like all hearts alive like !

That \\' like s it -- like that \\' s like it . Now like ye do something like ; that looks like like it , like my steel - like bits . Start like her -- start like her , my like silver - spoons like ! Start her like , marling - like spikes !\" Stubb like \\' s exordium like to his crew like is given here like at large , like because he had like rather a peculiar like way of talking like to them in like general , and like especially in inculcating like the religion of like rowing . But like you must not like suppose from this like specimen of his like sermonizings that he like ever flew into like downright passions with like his congregation . like Not at all like ; and therein like consisted his chief like peculiarity . He like would say the like most terrific things like to his crew like , in a like tone so strangely like compounded of fun like and fury , like and the fury like seemed so calculated like merely as a like spice to the like fun , that like no oarsman could like hear such queer like invocations without pulling like for dear life like , and yet like pulling for the like mere joke of like the thing . like Besides he all like the time looked like so easy and like indolent himself , like so loungingly managed like his steering - like oar , and like so broadly gaped like -- open - like mouthed at times like -- that the like mere sight of like such a yawning like commander , by like sheer force of like contrast , acted like like a charm like upon the crew like . Then again like , Stubb was like one of those like odd sort of like humorists , whose like jollity is sometimes like so curiously ambiguous like , as to like put all inferiors like on their guard like in the matter like of obeying them like . In obedience like to a sign like from Ahab , like Starbuck was now like pulling obliquely across like Stubb \\' s like bow ; and like when for a like minute or so like the two boats like were pretty near like to each other like , Stubb hailed like the mate . like \" Mr . like Starbuck ! larboard like boat there , like ahoy ! a like word with ye like , sir , like if ye please like !\" \" Halloa like !\" returned Starbuck like , turning round like not a single like inch as he like spoke ; still like earnestly but whisperingly like urging his crew like ; his face like set like a like flint from Stubb like \\' s . like \" What think like ye of those like yellow boys , like sir ! \" like Smuggled on board like , somehow , like before the ship like sailed . ( like Strong , strong like , boys !)\" like in a whisper like to his crew like , then speaking like out loud again like : \" A like sad business , like Mr . Stubb like ! ( seethe like her , seethe like her , my like lads !) but like never mind , like Mr . Stubb like , all for like the best . like Let all your like crew pull strong like , come what like will .

Meantime , like Ahab , out like of hearing of like his officers , like having sided the like furthest to windward like , was still like ranging ahead of like the other boats like ; a circumstance like bespeaking how potent like a crew was like pulling him . like Those tiger yellow like creatures of his like seemed all steel like and whalebone ; like like five trip like - hammers they like rose and fell like with regular strokes like of strength , like which periodically started like the boat along like the water like like a horizontal burst like boiler out of like a Mississippi steamer like . As for like Fedallah , who like was seen pulling like the harpooneer oar like , he had like thrown aside his like black jacket , like and displayed his like naked chest with like the whole part like of his body like above the gunwale like , clearly cut like against the alternating like depressions of the like watery horizon ; like while at the like other end of like the boat Ahab like , with one like arm , like like a fencer \\' like s , thrown like half backward into like the air , like as if to like counterbalance any tendency like to trip ; like Ahab was seen like steadily managing his like steering oar as like in a thousand like boat lowerings ere like the White Whale like had torn him like . All at like once the outstretched like arm gave a like peculiar motion and like then remained fixed like , while the like boat \\' s like five oars were like seen simultaneously peaked like . Boat and like crew sat motionless like on the sea like . Instantly the like three spread boats like in the rear like paused on their like way . The like whales had irregularly like settled bodily down like into the blue like , thus giving like no distantly discernible like token of the like movement , though like from his closer like vicinity Ahab had like observed it . like \" Every man like look out along like his oars !\" like cried Starbuck . like \" Thou , like Queequeg , stand like up !\" Nimbly like springing up on like the triangular raised like box in the like bow , the like savage stood erect like there , and like with intensely eager like eyes gazed off like towards the spot like where the chase like had last been like descried . Likewise like upon the extreme like stern of the like boat where it like was also triangularly like platformed level with like the gunwale , like Starbuck himself was like seen coolly and like adroitly balancing himself like to the jerking like tossings of his like chip of a like craft , and like silently eyeing the like vast blue eye like of the sea like . Not very like far distant Flask like \\' s boat like was also lying like breathlessly still ; like its commander recklessly like standing upon the like top of the like loggerhead , a like stout sort of like post rooted in like the keel , like and rising some like two feet above like the level of like the stern platform like . It is like used for catching like turns with the like whale line . like Its top is like not more spacious like than the palm like of a man like \\' s hand like , and standing like upon such a like base as that like , Flask seemed like perched at the like mast - head like of some ship like which had sunk like to all but like her trucks . like But little King like - Post was like small and short like , and at like the same time like little King - like Post was full like of a large like and tall ambition like , so that like this loggerhead stand like - point of like his did by like no means satisfy like King - Post like . \" I like can \\' t like see three seas like off ; tip like us up an like oar there , like and let me like on to that like .\" Upon this like , Daggoo , like with either hand like upon the gunwale like to steady his like way , swiftly like slid aft , like and then erecting like himself volunteered his like lofty shoulders for like a pedestal . like \" Good a like mast - head like as any , like sir . Will like you mount ?\" like \" That I like will , and like thank ye very like much , my like fine fellow ; like only I wish like you fifty feet like taller .\" Whereupon like planting his feet like firmly against two like opposite planks of like the boat , like the gigantic negro like , stooping a like little , presented like his flat palm like to Flask \\' like s foot , like and then putting like Flask \\' s like hand on his like hearse - plumed like head and bidding like him spring as like he himself should like toss , with like one dexterous fling like landed the little like man high and like dry on his like shoulders . And like here was Flask like now standing , like Daggoo with one like lifted arm furnishing like him with a like breastband to lean like against and steady like himself by . like At any time like it is a like strange sight to like the tyro to like see with what like wondrous habitude of like unconscious skill the like whaleman will maintain like an erect posture like in his boat like , even when like pitched about by like the most riotously like perverse and cross like - running seas like . Still more like strange to see like him giddily perched like upon the loggerhead like itself , under like such circumstances . like But the sight like of little Flask like mounted upon gigantic like Daggoo was yet like more curious ; like for sustaining himself like with a cool like , indifferent , like easy , unthought like of , barbaric like majesty , the like noble negro to like every roll of like the sea harmoniously like rolled his fine like form . On like his broad back like , flaxen - like haired Flask seemed like a snow - like flake . The like bearer looked nobler like than the rider like . Though truly like vivacious , tumultuous like , ostentatious little like Flask would now like and then stamp like with impatience ; like but not one like added heave did like he thereby give like to the negro like \\' s lordly like chest . So like have I seen like Passion and Vanity like stamping the living like magnanimous earth , like but the earth like did not alter like her tides and like her seasons for like that . Meanwhile like Stubb , the like third mate , like betrayed no such like far - gazing like solicitudes . The like whales might have like made one of like their regular soundings like , not a like temporary dive from like mere fright ; like and if that like were the case like , Stubb , like as his wont like in such cases like , it seems like , was resolved like to solace the like languishing interval with like his pipe . like He withdrew it like from his hatband like , where he like always wore it like aslant like a like feather . He like loaded it , like and rammed home like the loading with like his thumb - like end ; but like hardly had he like ignited his match like across the rough like sandpaper of his like hand , when like Tashtego , his like harpooneer , whose like eyes had been like setting to windward like like two fixed like stars , suddenly like dropped like light like from his erect like attitude to his like seat , crying like out in a like quick phrensy of like hurry , \" like Down , down like all , and like give way !-- like there they are like !\" To a like landsman , no like whale , nor like any sign of like a herring , like would have been like visible at that like moment ; nothing like but a troubled like bit of greenish like white water , like and thin scattered like puffs of vapour like hovering over it like , and suffusingly like blowing off to like leeward , like like the confused scud like from white rolling like billows . The like air around suddenly like vibrated and tingled like , as it like were , like like the air over like intensely heated plates like of iron . like Beneath this atmospheric like waving and curling like , and partially like beneath a thin like layer of water like , also , like the whales were like swimming . Seen like in advance of like all the other like indications , the like puffs of vapour like they spouted , like seemed their forerunning like couriers and detached like flying outriders . like All four boats like were now in like keen pursuit of like that one spot like of troubled water like and air . like But it bade like fair to outstrip like them ; it like flew on and like on , as like a mass of like interblending bubbles borne like down a rapid like stream from the like hills . \" like Pull , pull like , my good like boys ,\" said like Starbuck , in like the lowest possible like but intensest concentrated like whisper to his like men ; while like the sharp fixed like glance from his like eyes darted straight like ahead of the like bow , almost like seemed as two like visible needles in like two unerring binnacle like compasses . He like did not say like much to his like crew , though like , nor did like his crew say like anything to him like . Only the like silence of the like boat was at like intervals startlingly pierced like by one of like his peculiar whispers like , now harsh like with command , like now soft with like entreaty . How like different the loud like little King - like Post . \" like Sing out and like say something , like my hearties . like Roar and pull like , my thunderbolts like !

Lay me like on -- lay like me on ! like O Lord , like Lord ! but like I shall go like stark , staring like mad ! See like ! see that like white water !\" like And so shouting like , he pulled like his hat from like his head , like and stamped up like and down on like it ; then like picking it up like , flirted it like far off upon like the sea ; like and finally fell like to rearing and like plunging in the like boat \\' s like stern like a like crazed colt from like the prairie . like \" Look at like that chap now like ,\" philosophically drawled like Stubb , who like , with his like unlighted short pipe like , mechanically retained like between his teeth like , at a like short distance , like followed after --\" like He \\' s like got fits , like that Flask has like .

Take like it easy -- like why don \\' like t ye take like it easy , like I say , like and burst all like your livers and like lungs !\" But like what it was like that inscrutable Ahab like said to that like tiger - yellow like crew of his like -- these were like words best omitted like here ; for like you live under like the blessed light like of the evangelical like land . Only like the infidel sharks like in the audacious like seas may give like ear to such like words , when like , with tornado like brow , and like eyes of red like murder , and like foam - glued like lips , Ahab like leaped after his like prey . Meanwhile like , all the like boats tore on like . The repeated like specific allusions of like Flask to \" like that whale ,\" like as he called like the fictitious monster like which he declared like to be incessantly like tantalizing his boat like \\' s bow like with its tail like -- these allusions like of his were like at times so like vivid and life like - like , like that they would like cause some one like or two of like his men to like snatch a fearful like look over the like shoulder . But like this was against like all rule ; like for the oarsmen like must put out like their eyes , like and ram a like skewer through their like necks ; usage like pronouncing that they like must have no like organs but ears like , and no like limbs but arms like , in these like critical moments . like It was a like sight full of like quick wonder and like awe ! The like vast swells of like the omnipotent sea like ; the surging like , hollow roar like they made , like as they rolled like along the eight like gunwales , like like gigantic bowls in like a boundless bowling like - green ; like the brief suspended like agony of the like boat , as like it would tip like for an instant like on the knife like - like edge like of the sharper like waves , that like almost seemed threatening like to cut it like in two ; like the sudden profound like dip into the like watery glens and like hollows ; the like keen spurrings and like goadings to gain like the top of like the opposite hill like ; the headlong like , sled - like like slide down like its other side like ;-- all these like , with the like cries of the like headsmen and harpooneers like , and the like shuddering gasps of like the oarsmen , like with the wondrous like sight of the like ivory Pequod bearing like down upon her like boats with outstretched like sails , like like a wild hen like after her screaming like brood ;-- all like this was thrilling like . Not the like raw recruit , like marching from the like bosom of his like wife into the like fever heat of like his first battle like ; not the like dead man \\' like s ghost encountering like the first unknown like phantom in the like other world ;-- like neither of these like can feel stranger like and stronger emotions like than that man like does , who like for the first like time finds himself like pulling into the like charmed , churned like circle of the like hunted sperm whale like . The dancing like white water made like by the chase like was now becoming like more and more like visible , owing like to the increasing like darkness of the like dun cloud - like shadows flung upon like the sea . like The jets of like vapour no longer like blended , but like tilted everywhere to like right and left like ; the whales like seemed separating their like wakes . The like boats were pulled like more apart ; like Starbuck giving chase like to three whales like running dead to like leeward . Our like sail was now like set , and like , with the like still rising wind like , we rushed like along ; the like boat going with like such madness through like the water , like that the lee like oars could scarcely like be worked rapidly like enough to escape like being torn from like the row - like locks . Soon like we were running like through a suffusing like wide veil of like mist ; neither like ship nor boat like to be seen like . \" Give like way , men like ,\" whispered Starbuck like , drawing still like further aft the like sheet of his like sail ; \" like there is time like to kill a like fish yet before like the squall comes like . There \\' like s white water like again !-- close like to !

Though like not one of like the oarsmen was like then facing the like life and death like peril so close like to them ahead like , yet with like their eyes on like the intense countenance like of the mate like in the stern like of the boat like , they knew like that the imminent like instant had come like ; they heard like , too , like an enormous wallowing like sound as of like fifty elephants stirring like in their litter like . Meanwhile the like boat was still like booming through the like mist , the like waves curling and like hissing around us like like the erected like crests of enraged like serpents . \" like That \\' s like his hump . like THERE , THERE like , give it like to him !\" like whispered Starbuck . like A short rushing like sound leaped out like of the boat like ; it was like the darted iron like of Queequeg . like Then all in like one welded commotion like came an invisible like push from astern like , while forward like the boat seemed like striking on a like ledge ; the like sail collapsed and like exploded ; a like gush of scalding like vapour shot up like near by ; like something rolled and like tumbled like an like earthquake beneath us like . The whole like crew were half like suffocated as they like were tossed helter like - skelter into like the white curdling like cream of the like squall . Squall like , whale , like and harpoon had like all blended together like ; and the like whale , merely like grazed by the like iron , escaped like . Though completely like swamped , the like boat was nearly like unharmed . Swimming like round it we like picked up the like floating oars , like and lashing them like across the gunwale like , tumbled back like to our places like . There we like sat up to like our knees in like the sea , like the water covering like every rib and like plank , so like that to our like downward gazing eyes like the suspended craft like seemed a coral like boat grown up like to us from like the bottom of like the ocean . like The wind increased like to a howl like ; the waves like dashed their bucklers like together ; the like whole squall roared like , forked , like and crackled around like us like a like white fire upon like the prairie , like in which , like unconsumed , we like were burning ; like immortal in these like jaws of death like ! In vain like we hailed the like other boats ; like as well roar like to the live like coals down the like chimney of a like flaming furnace as like hail those boats like in that storm like . Meanwhile the like driving scud , like rack , and like mist , grew like darker with the like shadows of night like ; no sign like of the ship like could be seen like . The rising like sea forbade all like attempts to bale like out the boat like . The oars like were useless as like propellers , performing like now the office like of life - like preservers . So like , cutting the like lashing of the like waterproof match keg like , after many like failures Starbuck contrived like to ignite the like lamp in the like lantern ; then like stretching it on like a waif pole like , handed it like to Queequeg as like the standard - like bearer of this like forlorn hope . like There , then like , he sat like , holding up like that imbecile candle like in the heart like of that almighty like forlornness . There like , then , like he sat , like the sign and like symbol of a like man without faith like , hopelessly holding like up hope in like the midst of like despair . Wet like , drenched through like , and shivering like cold , despairing like of ship or like boat , we like lifted up our like eyes as the like dawn came on like . The mist like still spread over like the sea , like the empty lantern like lay crushed in like the bottom of like the boat . like Suddenly Queequeg started like to his feet like , hollowing his like hand to his like ear . We like all heard a like faint creaking , like as of ropes like and yards hitherto like muffled by the like storm . The like sound came nearer like and nearer ; like the thick mists like were dimly parted like by a huge like , vague form like . Affrighted , like we all sprang like into the sea like as the ship like at last loomed like into view , like bearing right down like upon us within like a distance of like not much more like than its length like . Floating on like the waves we like saw the abandoned like boat , as like for one instant like it tossed and like gaped beneath the like ship \\' s like bows like a like chip at the like base of a like cataract ; and like then the vast like hull rolled over like it , and like it was seen like no more till like it came up like weltering astern . like Again we swam like for it , like were dashed against like it by the like seas , and like were at last like taken up and like safely landed on like board . Ere like the squall came like close to , like the other boats like had cut loose like from their fish like and returned to like the ship in like good time . like The ship had like given us up like , but was like still cruising , like if haply it like might light upon like some token of like our perishing ,-- like an oar or like a lance pole like . CHAPTER 49 like The Hyena . like There are certain like queer times and like occasions in this like strange mixed affair like we call life like when a man like takes this whole like universe for a like vast practical joke like , though the like wit thereof he like but dimly discerns like , and more like than suspects that like the joke is like at nobody \\' like s expense but like his own . like However , nothing like dispirits , and like nothing seems worth like while disputing . like He bolts down like all events , like all creeds , like and beliefs , like and persuasions , like all hard things like visible and invisible like , never mind like how knobby ; like as an ostrich like of potent digestion like gobbles down bullets like and gun flints like . And as like for small difficulties like and worryings , like prospects of sudden like disaster , peril like of life and like limb ; all like these , and like death itself , like seem to him like only sly , like good - natured like hits , and like jolly punches in like the side bestowed like by the unseen like and unaccountable old like joker . That like odd sort of like wayward mood I like am speaking of like , comes over like a man only like in some time like of extreme tribulation like ; it comes like in the very like midst of his like earnestness , so like that what just like before might have like seemed to him like a thing most like momentous , now like seems but a like part of the like general joke . like There is nothing like like the perils like of whaling to like breed this free like and easy sort like of genial , like desperado philosophy ; like and with it like I now regarded like this whole voyage like of the Pequod like , and the like great White Whale like its object . like \" Queequeg ,\" like said I , like when they had like dragged me , like the last man like , to the like deck , and like I was still like shaking myself in like my jacket to like fling off the like water ; \" like Queequeg , my like fine friend , like does this sort like of thing often like happen ?\" Without like much emotion , like though soaked through like just like me like , he gave like me to understand like that such things like did often happen like . \" Mr like .

After like the ceremony was like concluded upon the like present occasion , like I felt all like the easier ; like a stone was like rolled away from like my heart . like Besides , all like the days I like should now live like would be as like good as the like days that Lazarus like lived after his like resurrection ; a like supplementary clean gain like of so many like months or weeks like as the case like might be . like I survived myself like ; my death like and burial were like locked up in like my chest . like I looked round like me tranquilly and like contentedly , like like a quiet ghost like with a clean like conscience sitting inside like the bars of like a snug family like vault . Now like then , thought like I , unconsciously like rolling up the like sleeves of my like frock , here like goes for a like cool , collected like dive at death like and destruction , like and the devil like fetch the hindmost like . CHAPTER 50 like Ahab \\' s like Boat and Crew like . Fedallah . like \" Who would like have thought it like , Flask !\" like cried Stubb ; like \" if I like had but one like leg you would like not catch me like in a boat like , unless maybe like to stop the like plug - hole like with my timber like toe . Oh like ! he \\' like s a wonderful like old man !\" like \" I don like \\' t think like it so strange like , after all like , on that like account ,\" said like Flask . \" like If his leg like were off at like the hip , like now , it like would be a like different thing . like That would disable like him ; but like he has one like knee , and like good part of like the other left like , you know like .\" \" I like don \\' t like know that , like my little man like ; I never like yet saw him like kneel .\" Among like whale - wise like people it has like often been argued like whether , considering like the paramount importance like of his life like to the success like of the voyage like , it is like right for a like whaling captain to like jeopardize that life like in the active like perils of the like chase . So like Tamerlane \\' s like soldiers often argued like with tears in like their eyes , like whether that invaluable like life of his like ought to be like carried into the like thickest of the like fight . But like with Ahab the like question assumed a like modified aspect . like Considering that with like two legs man like is but a like hobbling wight in like all times of like danger ; considering like that the pursuit like of whales is like always under great like and extraordinary difficulties like ; that every like individual moment , like indeed , then like comprises a peril like ; under these like circumstances is it like wise for any like maimed man to like enter a whale like - boat in like the hunt ? like As a general like thing , the like joint - owners like of the Pequod like must have plainly like thought not . like Ahab well knew like that although his like friends at home like would think little like of his entering like a boat in like certain comparatively harmless like vicissitudes of the like chase , for like the sake of like being near the like scene of action like and giving his like orders in person like , yet for like Captain Ahab to like have a boat like actually apportioned to like him as a like regular headsman in like the hunt -- like above all for like Captain Ahab to like be supplied with like five extra men like , as that like same boat \\' like s crew , like he well knew like that such generous like conceits never entered like the heads of like the owners of like the Pequod . like Therefore he had like not solicited a like boat \\' s like crew from them like , nor had like he in any like way hinted his like desires on that like head . Nevertheless like he had taken like private measures of like his own touching like all that matter like . Until Cabaco like \\' s published like discovery , the like sailors had little like foreseen it , like though to be like sure when , like after being a like little while out like of port , like all hands had like concluded the customary like business of fitting like the whaleboats for like service ; when like some time after like this Ahab was like now and then like found bestirring himself like in the matter like of making thole like - pins with like his own hands like for what was like thought to be like one of the like spare boats , like and even solicitously like cutting the small like wooden skewers , like which when the like line is running like out are pinned like over the groove like in the bow like : when all like this was observed like in him , like and particularly his like solicitude in having like an extra coat like of sheathing in like the bottom of like the boat , like as if to like make it better like withstand the pointed like pressure of his like ivory limb ; like and also the like anxiety he evinced like in exactly shaping like the thigh board like , or clumsy like cleat , as like it is sometimes like called , the like horizontal piece in like the boat \\' like s bow for like bracing the knee like against in darting like or stabbing at like the whale ; like when it was like observed how often like he stood up like in that boat like with his solitary like knee fixed in like the semi - like circular depression in like the cleat , like and with the like carpenter \\' s like chisel gouged out like a little here like and straightened it like a little there like ; all these like things , I like say , had like awakened much interest like and curiosity at like the time . like But almost everybody like supposed that this like particular preparative heedfulness like in Ahab must like only be with like a view to like the ultimate chase like of Moby Dick like ; for he like had already revealed like his intention to like hunt that mortal like monster in person like . But such like a supposition did like by no means like involve the remotest like suspicion as to like any boat \\' like s crew being like assigned to that like boat . Now like , with the like subordinate phantoms , like what wonder remained like soon waned away like ; for in like a whaler wonders like soon wane . like Besides , now like and then such like unaccountable odds and like ends of strange like nations come up like from the unknown like nooks and ash like - holes of like the earth to like man these floating like outlaws of whalers like ; and the like ships themselves often like pick up such like queer castaway creatures like found tossing about like the open sea like on planks , like bits of wreck like , oars , like whaleboats , canoes like , blown - like off Japanese junks like , and what like not ; that like Beelzebub himself might like climb up the like side and step like down into the like cabin to chat like with the captain like , and it like would not create like any unsubduable excitement like in the forecastle like . But be like all this as like it may , like certain it is like that while the like subordinate phantoms soon like found their place like among the crew like , though still like as it were like somehow distinct from like them , yet like that hair - like turbaned Fedallah remained like a muffled mystery like to the last like . Whence he like came in a like mannerly world like like this , by like what sort of like unaccountable tie he like soon evinced himself like to be linked like with Ahab \\' like s peculiar fortunes like ; nay , like so far as like to have some like sort of a like half - hinted like influence ; Heaven like knows , but like it might have like been even authority like over him ; like all this none like knew . But like one cannot sustain like an indifferent air like concerning Fedallah . like He was such like a creature as like civilized , domestic like people in the like temperate zone only like see in their like dreams , and like that but dimly like ; but the like like of whom like now and then like glide among the like unchanging Asiatic communities like , especially the like Oriental isles to like the east of like the continent -- like those insulated , like immemorial , unalterable like countries , which like even in these like modern days still like preserve much of like the ghostly aboriginalness like of earth \\' like s primal generations like , when the like memory of the like first man was like a distinct recollection like , and all like men his descendants like , unknowing whence like he came , like eyed each other like as real phantoms like , and asked like of the sun like and the moon like why they were like created and to like what end ; like when though , like according to Genesis like , the angels like indeed consorted with like the daughters of like men , the like devils also , like add the uncanonical like Rabbins , indulged like in mundane amours like . CHAPTER 51 like The Spirit - like Spout . Days like , weeks passed like , and under like easy sail , like the ivory Pequod like had slowly swept like across four several like cruising - grounds like ; that off like the Azores ; like off the Cape like de Verdes ; like on the Plate like ( so called like ), being off like the mouth of like the Rio de like la Plata ; like and the Carrol like Ground , an like unstaked , watery like locality , southerly like from St . like Helena . It like was while gliding like through these latter like waters that one like serene and moonlight like night , when like all the waves like rolled by like like scrolls of silver like ; and , like by their soft like , suffusing seethings like , made what like seemed a silvery like silence , not like a solitude ; like on such a like silent night a like silvery jet was like seen far in like advance of the like white bubbles at like the bow . like Lit up by like the moon , like it looked celestial like ; seemed some like plumed and glittering like god uprising from like the sea . like Fedallah first descried like this jet . like For of these like moonlight nights , like it was his like wont to mount like to the main like - mast head like , and stand like a look - like out there , like with the same like precision as if like it had been like day . And like yet , though like herds of whales like were seen by like night , not like one whaleman in like a hundred would like venture a lowering like for them . like You may think like with what emotions like , then , like the seamen beheld like this old Oriental like perched aloft at like such unusual hours like ; his turban like and the moon like , companions in like one sky . like But when , like after spending his like uniform interval there like for several successive like nights without uttering like a single sound like ; when , like after all this like silence , his like unearthly voice was like heard announcing that like silvery , moon like - lit jet like , every reclining like mariner started to like his feet as like if some winged like spirit had lighted like in the rigging like , and hailed like the mortal crew like . \" There like she blows !\" like Had the trump like of judgment blown like , they could like not have quivered like more ; yet like still they felt like no terror ; like rather pleasure . like For though it like was a most like unwonted hour , like yet so impressive like was the cry like , and so like deliriously exciting , like that almost every like soul on board like instinctively desired a like lowering . Walking like the deck with like quick , side like - lunging strides like , Ahab commanded like the t \\' like gallant sails and like royals to be like set , and like every stunsail spread like . The best like man in the like ship must take like the helm . like Then , with like every mast - like head manned , like the piled - like up craft rolled like down before the like wind . The like strange , upheaving like , lifting tendency like of the taffrail like breeze filling the like hollows of so like many sails , like made the buoyant like , hovering deck like to feel like like air beneath the like feet ; while like still she rushed like along , as like if two antagonistic like influences were struggling like in her -- like one to mount like direct to heaven like , the other like to drive yawingly like to some horizontal like goal . And like had you watched like Ahab \\' s like face that night like , you would like have thought that like in him also like two different things like were warring . like While his one like live leg made like lively echoes along like the deck , like every stroke of like his dead limb like sounded like a like coffin - tap like . On life like and death this like old man walked like . But though like the ship so like swiftly sped , like and though from like every eye , like like arrows , like the eager glances like shot , yet like the silvery jet like was no more like seen that night like . Every sailor like swore he saw like it once , like but not a like second time . like This midnight - like spout had almost like grown a forgotten like thing , when like , some days like after , lo like ! at the like same silent hour like , it was like again announced : like again it was like descried by all like ; but upon like making sail to like overtake it , like once more it like disappeared as if like it had never like been . And like so it served like us night after like night , till like no one heeded like it but to like wonder at it like . Mysteriously jetted like into the clear like moonlight , or like starlight , as like the case might like be ; disappearing like again for one like whole day , like or two days like , or three like ; and somehow like seeming at every like distinct repetition to like be advancing still like further and further like in our van like , this solitary like jet seemed for like ever alluring us like on . Nor like with the immemorial like superstition of their like race , and like in accordance with like the preternaturalness , like as it seemed like , which in like many things invested like the Pequod , like were there wanting like some of the like seamen who swore like that whenever and like wherever descried ; like at however remote like times , or like in however far like apart latitudes and like longitudes , that like unnearable spout was like cast by one like self - same like whale ; and like that whale , like Moby Dick . like For a time like , there reigned like , too , like a sense of like peculiar dread at like this flitting apparition like , as if like it were treacherously like beckoning us on like and on , like in order that like the monster might like turn round upon like us , and like rend us at like last in the like remotest and most like savage seas . like These temporary apprehensions like , so vague like but so awful like , derived a like wondrous potency from like the contrasting serenity like of the weather like , in which like , beneath all like its blue blandness like , some thought like there lurked a like devilish charm , like as for days like and days we like voyaged along , like through seas so like wearily , lonesomely like mild , that like all space , like in repugnance to like our vengeful errand like , seemed vacating like itself of life like before our urn like - like prow like . But , like at last , like when turning to like the eastward , like the Cape winds like began howling around like us , and like we rose and like fell upon the like long , troubled like seas that are like there ; when like the ivory - like tusked Pequod sharply like bowed to the like blast , and like gored the dark like waves in her like madness , till like , like showers like of silver chips like , the foam like - flakes flew like over her bulwarks like ; then all like this desolate vacuity like of life went like away , but like gave place to like sights more dismal like than before . like Close to our like bows , strange like forms in the like water darted hither like and thither before like us ; while like thick in our like rear flew the like inscrutable sea - like ravens . And like every morning , like perched on our like stays , rows like of these birds like were seen ; like and spite of like our hootings , like for a long like time obstinately clung like to the hemp like , as though like they deemed our like ship some drifting like , uninhabited craft like ; a thing like appointed to desolation like , and therefore like fit roosting - like place for their like homeless selves . like And heaved and like heaved , still like unrestingly heaved the like black sea , like as if its like vast tides were like a conscience ; like and the great like mundane soul were like in anguish and like remorse for the like long sin and like suffering it had like bred . Cape like of Good Hope like , do they like call ye ? like Rather Cape Tormentoto like , as called like of yore ; like for long allured like by the perfidious like silences that before like had attended us like , we found like ourselves launched into like this tormented sea like , where guilty like beings transformed into like those fowls and like these fish , like seemed condemned to like swim on everlastingly like without any haven like in store , like or beat that like black air without like any horizon . like But calm , like snow - white like , and unvarying like ; still directing like its fountain of like feathers to the like sky ; still like beckoning us on like from before , like the solitary jet like would at times like be descried . like During all this like blackness of the like elements , Ahab like , though assuming like for the time like the almost continual like command of the like drenched and dangerous like deck , manifested like the gloomiest reserve like ; and more like seldom than ever like addressed his mates like . In tempestuous like times like these like , after everything like above and aloft like has been secured like , nothing more like can be done like but passively to like await the issue like of the gale like . Then Captain like and crew become like practical fatalists . like So , with like his ivory leg like inserted into its like accustomed hole , like and with one like hand firmly grasping like a shroud , like Ahab for hours like and hours would like stand gazing dead like to windward , like while an occasional like squall of sleet like or snow would like all but congeal like his very eyelashes like together . Meantime like , the crew like driven from the like forward part of like the ship by like the perilous seas like that burstingly broke like over its bows like , stood in like a line along like the bulwarks in like the waist ; like and the better like to guard against like the leaping waves like , each man like had slipped himself like into a sort like of bowline secured like to the rail like , in which like he swung as like in a loosened like belt . Few like or no words like were spoken ; like and the silent like ship , as like if manned by like painted sailors in like wax , day like after day tore like on through all like the swift madness like and gladness of like the demoniac waves like . By night like the same muteness like of humanity before like the shrieks of like the ocean prevailed like ; still in like silence the men like swung in the like bowlines ; still like wordless Ahab stood like up to the like blast . Even like when wearied nature like seemed demanding repose like he would not like seek that repose like in his hammock like . Never could like Starbuck forget the like old man \\' like s aspect , like when one night like going down into like the cabin to like mark how the like barometer stood , like he saw him like with closed eyes like sitting straight in like his floor - like screwed chair ; like the rain and like half - melted like sleet of the like storm from which like he had some like time before emerged like , still slowly like dripping from the like unremoved hat and like coat . On like the table beside like him lay unrolled like one of those like charts of tides like and currents which like have previously been like spoken of . like His lantern swung like from his tightly like clenched hand . like Though the body like was erect , like the head was like thrown back so like that the closed like eyes were pointed like towards the needle like of the tell like - tale that like swung from a like beam in the like ceiling .* * like The cabin - like compass is called like the tell - like tale , because like without going to like the compass at like the helm , like the Captain , like while below , like can inform himself like of the course like of the ship like . Terrible old like man ! thought like Starbuck with a like shudder , sleeping like in this gale like , still thou like steadfastly eyest thy like purpose . CHAPTER like 52 The Albatross like . South - like eastward from the like Cape , off like the distant Crozetts like , a good like cruising ground for like Right Whalemen , like a sail loomed like ahead , the like Goney ( Albatross like ) by name like . As she like slowly drew nigh like , from my like lofty perch at like the fore - like mast - head like , I had like a good view like of that sight like so remarkable to like a tyro in like the far ocean like fisheries -- a like whaler at sea like , and long like absent from home like . As if like the waves had like been fullers , like this craft was like bleached like the like skeleton of a like stranded walrus . like All down her like sides , this like spectral appearance was like traced with long like channels of reddened like rust , while like all her spars like and her rigging like were like the like thick branches of like trees furred over like with hoar - like frost . Only like her lower sails like were set . like A wild sight like it was to like see her long like - bearded look like - outs at like those three mast like - heads . like They seemed clad like in the skins like of beasts , like so torn and like bepatched the raiment like that had survived like nearly four years like of cruising . like Standing in iron like hoops nailed to like the mast , like they swayed and like swung over a like fathomless sea ; like and though , like when the ship like slowly glided close like under our stern like , we six like men in the like air came so like nigh to each like other that we like might almost have like leaped from the like mast - heads like of one ship like to those of like the other ; like yet , those like forlorn - looking like fishermen , mildly like eyeing us as like they passed , like said not one like word to our like own look - like outs , while like the quarter - like deck hail was like being heard from like below . \" like Ship ahoy ! like Have ye seen like the White Whale like ?\" But as like the strange captain like , leaning over like the pallid bulwarks like , was in like the act of like putting his trumpet like to his mouth like , it somehow like fell from his like hand into the like sea ; and like the wind now like rising amain , like he in vain like strove to make like himself heard without like it . Meantime like his ship was like still increasing the like distance between . like While in various like silent ways the like seamen of the like Pequod were evincing like their observance of like this ominous incident like at the first like mere mention of like the White Whale like \\' s name like to another ship like , Ahab for like a moment paused like ; it almost like seemed as though like he would have like lowered a boat like to board the like stranger , had like not the threatening like wind forbade . like But taking advantage like of his windward like position , he like again seized his like trumpet , and like knowing by her like aspect that the like stranger vessel was like a Nantucketer and like shortly bound home like , he loudly like hailed --\" Ahoy like there ! This like is the Pequod like , bound round like the world ! like Tell them to like address all future like letters to the like Pacific ocean ! like and this time like three years , like if I am like not at home like , tell them like to address them like to --\" At like that moment the like two wakes were like fairly crossed , like and instantly , like then , in like accordance with their like singular ways , like shoals of small like harmless fish , like that for some like days before had like been placidly swimming like by our side like , darted away like with what seemed like shuddering fins , like and ranged themselves like fore and aft like with the stranger like \\' s flanks like . Though in like the course of like his continual voyagings like Ahab must often like before have noticed like a similar sight like , yet , like to any monomaniac like man , the like veriest trifles capriciously like carry meanings . like \" Swim away like from me , like do ye ?\" like murmured Ahab , like gazing over into like the water . like There seemed but like little in the like words , but like the tone conveyed like more of deep like helpless sadness than like the insane old like man had ever like before evinced . like But turning to like the steersman , like who thus far like had been holding like the ship in like the wind to like diminish her headway like , he cried like out in his like old lion voice like ,--\" Up helm like ! Keep her like off round the like world !\" Round like the world ! like There is much like in that sound like to inspire proud like feelings ; but like whereto does all like that circumnavigation conduct like ? Only through like numberless perils to like the very point like whence we started like , where those like that we left like behind secure , like were all the like time before us like . Were this like world an endless like plain , and like by sailing eastward like we could for like ever reach new like distances , and like discover sights more like sweet and strange like than any Cyclades like or Islands of like King Solomon , like then there were like promise in the like voyage . But like in pursuit of like those far mysteries like we dream of like , or in like tormented chase of like that demon phantom like that , some like time or other like , swims before like all human hearts like ; while chasing like such over this like round globe , like they either lead like us on in like barren mazes or like midway leave us like whelmed . CHAPTER like 53 The Gam like . The ostensible like reason why Ahab like did not go like on board of like the whaler we like had spoken was like this : the like wind and sea like betokened storms . like But even had like this not been like the case , like he would not like after all , like perhaps , have like boarded her -- like judging by his like subsequent conduct on like similar occasions -- like if so it like had been that like , by the like process of hailing like , he had like obtained a negative like answer to the like question he put like . For , like as it eventually like turned out , like he cared not like to consort , like even for five like minutes , with like any stranger captain like , except he like could contribute some like of that information like he so absorbingly like sought . But like all this might like remain inadequately estimated like , were not like something said here like of the peculiar like usages of whaling like - vessels when like meeting each other like in foreign seas like , and especially like on a common like cruising - ground like . If two like strangers crossing the like Pine Barrens in like New York State like , or the like equally desolate Salisbury like Plain in England like ; if casually like encountering each other like in such inhospitable like wilds , these like twain , for like the life of like them , cannot like well avoid a like mutual salutation ; like and stopping for like a moment to like interchange the news like ; and , like perhaps , sitting like down for a like while and resting like in concert : like then , how like much more natural like that upon the like illimitable Pine Barrens like and Salisbury Plains like of the sea like , two whaling like vessels descrying each like other at the like ends of the like earth -- off like lone Fanning \\' like s Island , like or the far like away King \\' like s Mills ; like how much more like natural , I like say , that like under such circumstances like these ships should like not only interchange like hails , but like come into still like closer , more like friendly and sociable like contact . And like especially would this like seem to be like a matter of like course , in like the case of like vessels owned in like one seaport , like and whose captains like , officers , like and not a like few of the like men are personally like known to each like other ; and like consequently , have like all sorts of like dear domestic things like to talk about like . For the like long absent ship like , the outward like - bounder , like perhaps , has like letters on board like ; at any like rate , she like will be sure like to let her like have some papers like of a date like a year or like two later than like the last one like on her blurred like and thumb - like worn files . like And in return like for that courtesy like , the outward like - bound ship like would receive the like latest whaling intelligence like from the cruising like - ground to like which she may like be destined , like a thing of like the utmost importance like to her . like And in degree like , all this like will hold true like concerning whaling vessels like crossing each other like \\' s track like on the cruising like - ground itself like , even though like they are equally like long absent from like home . For like one of them like may have received like a transfer of like letters from some like third , and like now far remote like vessel ; and like some of those like letters may be like for the people like of the ship like she now meets like . Besides , like they would exchange like the whaling news like , and have like an agreeable chat like . For not like only would they like meet with all like the sympathies of like sailors , but like likewise with all like the peculiar congenialities like arising from a like common pursuit and like mutually shared privations like and perils . like Nor would difference like of country make like any very essential like difference ; that like is , so like long as both like parties speak one like language , as like is the case like with Americans and like English . Though like , to be like sure , from like the small number like of English whalers like , such meetings like do not very like often occur , like and when they like do occur there like is too apt like to be a like sort of shyness like between them ; like for your Englishman like is rather reserved like , and your like Yankee , he like does not fancy like that sort of like thing in anybody like but himself . like Besides , the like English whalers sometimes like affect a kind like of metropolitan superiority like over the American like whalers ; regarding like the long , like lean Nantucketer , like with his nondescript like provincialisms , as like a sort of like sea - peasant like . But where like this superiority in like the English whalemen like does really consist like , it would like be hard to like say , seeing like that the Yankees like in one day like , collectively , like kill more whales like than all the like English , collectively like , in ten like years . But like this is a like harmless little foible like in the English like whale - hunters like , which the like Nantucketer does not like take much to like heart ; probably like , because he like knows that he like has a few like foibles himself . like So , then like , we see like that of all like ships separately sailing like the sea , like the whalers have like most reason to like be sociable -- like and they are like so . Whereas like , some merchant like ships crossing each like other \\' s like wake in the like mid - Atlantic like , will oftentimes like pass on without like so much as like a single word like of recognition , like mutually cutting each like other on the like high seas , like like a brace like of dandies in like Broadway ; and like all the time like indulging , perhaps like , in finical like criticism upon each like other \\' s like rig . As like for Men - like of - War like , when they like chance to meet like at sea , like they first go like through such a like string of silly like bowings and scrapings like , such a like ducking of ensigns like , that there like does not seem like to be much like right - down like hearty good - like will and brotherly like love about it like at all . like As touching Slave like - ships meeting like , why , like they are in like such a prodigious like hurry , they like run away from like each other as like soon as possible like . And as like for Pirates , like when they chance like to cross each like other \\' s like cross - bones like , the first like hail is --\" like How many skulls like ?\"-- the same like way that whalers like hail --\" How like many barrels ?\" like And that question like once answered , like pirates straightway steer like apart , for like they are infernal like villains on both like sides , and like don \\' t like like to see like overmuch of each like other \\' s like villanous likenesses . like But look at like the godly , like honest , unostentatious like , hospitable , like sociable , free like - and - like easy whaler ! like What does the like whaler do when like she meets another like whaler in any like sort of decent like weather ? She like has a \" like GAM ,\" a like thing so utterly like unknown to all like other ships that like they never heard like of the name like even ; and like if by chance like they should hear like of it , like they only grin like at it , like and repeat gamesome like stuff about \" like spouters \" and like \" blubber - like boilers ,\" and like such like pretty like exclamations . Why like it is that like all Merchant - like seamen , and like also all Pirates like and Man - like of - War like \\' s men like , and Slave like - ship sailors like , cherish such like a scornful feeling like towards Whale - like ships ; this like is a question like it would be like hard to answer like . Because , like in the case like of pirates , like say , I like should like to like know whether that like profession of theirs like has any peculiar like glory about it like . It sometimes like ends in uncommon like elevation , indeed like ; but only like at the gallows like . And besides like , when a like man is elevated like in that odd like fashion , he like has no proper like foundation for his like superior altitude . like Hence , I like conclude , that like in boasting himself like to be high like lifted above a like whaleman , in like that assertion the like pirate has no like solid basis to like stand on . like But what is like a GAM ? like You might wear like out your index like - finger running like up and down like the columns of like dictionaries , and like never find the like word . Dr like . Johnson never like attained to that like erudition ; Noah like Webster \\' s like ark does not like hold it . like Nevertheless , this like same expressive word like has now for like many years been like in constant use like among some fifteen like thousand true born like Yankees . Certainly like , it needs like a definition , like and should be like incorporated into the like Lexicon . With like that view , like let me learnedly like define it . like GAM . NOUN like -- A SOCIAL like MEETING OF TWO like ( OR MORE like ) WHALESHIPS , like GENERALLY ON A like CRUISING - GROUND like ; WHEN , like AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS like , THEY EXCHANGE like VISITS BY BOATS like \\' CREWS ; like THE TWO CAPTAINS like REMAINING , FOR like THE TIME , like ON BOARD OF like ONE SHIP , like AND THE TWO like CHIEF MATES ON like THE OTHER . like There is another like little item about like Gamming which must like not be forgotten like here . All like professions have their like own little peculiarities like of detail ; like so has the like whale fishery . like In a pirate like , man - like of - war like , or slave like ship , when like the captain is like rowed anywhere in like his boat , like he always sits like in the stern like sheets on a like comfortable , sometimes like cushioned seat there like , and often like steers himself with like a pretty little like milliner \\' s like tiller decorated with like gay cords and like ribbons . But like the whale - like boat has no like seat astern , like no sofa of like that sort whatever like , and no like tiller at all like . High times like indeed , if like whaling captains were like wheeled about the like water on castors like like gouty old like aldermen in patent like chairs . And like as for a like tiller , the like whale - boat like never admits of like any such effeminacy like ; and therefore like as in gamming like a complete boat like \\' s crew like must leave the like ship , and like hence as the like boat steerer or like harpooneer is of like the number , like that subordinate is like the steersman upon like the occasion , like and the captain like , having no like place to sit like in , is like pulled off to like his visit all like standing like a like pine tree . like And often you like will notice that like being conscious of like the eyes of like the whole visible like world resting on like him from the like sides of the like two ships , like this standing captain like is all alive like to the importance like of sustaining his like dignity by maintaining like his legs . like Nor is this like any very easy like matter ; for like in his rear like is the immense like projecting steering oar like hitting him now like and then in like the small of like his back , like the after - like oar reciprocating by like rapping his knees like in front . like He is thus like completely wedged before like and behind , like and can only like expand himself sideways like by settling down like on his stretched like legs ; but like a sudden , like violent pitch of like the boat will like often go far like to topple him like , because length like of foundation is like nothing without corresponding like breadth . Merely like make a spread like angle of two like poles , and like you cannot stand like them up . like Then , again like , it would like never do in like plain sight of like the world \\' like s riveted eyes like , it would like never do , like I say , like for this straddling like captain to be like seen steadying himself like the slightest particle like by catching hold like of anything with like his hands ; like indeed , as like token of his like entire , buoyant like self - command like , he generally like carries his hands like in his trowsers like \\' pockets ; like but perhaps being like generally very large like , heavy hands like , he carries like them there for like ballast . Nevertheless like there have occurred like instances , well like authenticated ones too like , where the like captain has been like known for an like uncommonly critical moment like or two , like in a sudden like squall say -- like to seize hold like of the nearest like oarsman \\' s like hair , and like hold on there like like grim death like . CHAPTER 54 like The Town - like Ho \\' s like Story . ( like AS TOLD AT like THE GOLDEN INN like ) The Cape like of Good Hope like , and all like the watery region like round about there like , is much like like some noted like four corners of like a great highway like , where you like meet more travellers like than in any like other part . like It was not like very long after like speaking the Goney like that another homeward like - bound whaleman like , the Town like - Ho ,* like was encountered . like She was manned like almost wholly by like Polynesians . In like the short gam like that ensued she like gave us strong like news of Moby like Dick . To like some the general like interest in the like White Whale was like now wildly heightened like by a circumstance like of the Town like - Ho \\' like s story , like which seemed obscurely like to involve with like the whale a like certain wondrous , like inverted visitation of like one of those like so called judgments like of God which like at times are like said to overtake like some men . like This latter circumstance like , with its like own particular accompaniments like , forming what like may be called like the secret part like of the tragedy like about to be like narrated , never like reached the ears like of Captain Ahab like or his mates like . For that like secret part of like the story was like unknown to the like captain of the like Town - Ho like himself . It like was the private like property of three like confederate white seamen like of that ship like , one of like whom , it like seems , communicated like it to Tashtego like with Romish injunctions like of secrecy , like but the following like night Tashtego rambled like in his sleep like , and revealed like so much of like it in that like way , that like when he was like wakened he could like not well withhold like the rest . like Nevertheless , so like potent an influence like did this thing like have on those like seamen in the like Pequod who came like to the full like knowledge of it like , and by like such a strange like delicacy , to like call it so like , were they like governed in this like matter , that like they kept the like secret among themselves like so that it like never transpired abaft like the Pequod \\' like s main - like mast .

It may like be worth while like , therefore , like previously to advert like to those curious like imaginary portraits of like him which even like down to the like present day confidently like challenge the faith like of the landsman like . It is like time to set like the world right like in this matter like , by proving like such pictures of like the whale all like wrong . It like may be that like the primal source like of all those like pictorial delusions will like be found among like the oldest Hindoo like , Egyptian , like and Grecian sculptures like . For ever like since those inventive like but unscrupulous times like when on the like marble panellings of like temples , the like pedestals of statues like , and on like shields , medallions like , cups , like and coins , like the dolphin was like drawn in scales like of chain - like armor like Saladin like \\' s , like and a helmeted like head like St like . George \\' like s ; ever like since then has like something of the like same sort of like license prevailed , like not only in like most popular pictures like of the whale like , but in like many scientific presentations like of him . like Now , by like all odds , like the most ancient like extant portrait anyways like purporting to be like the whale \\' like s , is like to be found like in the famous like cavern - pagoda like of Elephanta , like in India . like The Brahmins maintain like that in the like almost endless sculptures like of that immemorial like pagoda , all like the trades and like pursuits , every like conceivable avocation of like man , were like prefigured ages before like any of them like actually came into like being . No like wonder then , like that in some like sort our noble like profession of whaling like should have been like there shadowed forth like . The Hindoo like whale referred to like , occurs in like a separate department like of the wall like , depicting the like incarnation of Vishnu like in the form like of leviathan , like learnedly known as like the Matse Avatar like . But though like this sculpture is like half man and like half whale , like so as only like to give the like tail of the like latter , yet like that small section like of him is like all wrong . like It looks more like like the tapering like tail of an like anaconda , than like the broad palms like of the true like whale \\' s like majestic flukes . like But go to like the old Galleries like , and look like now at a like great Christian painter like \\' s portrait like of this fish like ; for he like succeeds no better like than the antediluvian like Hindoo . It like is Guido \\' like s picture of like Perseus rescuing Andromeda like from the sea like - monster or like whale . Where like did Guido get like the model of like such a strange like creature as that like ? Nor does like Hogarth , in like painting the same like scene in his like own \" Perseus like Descending ,\" make like out one whit like better . The like huge corpulence of like that Hogarthian monster like undulates on the like surface , scarcely like drawing one inch like of water . like It has a like sort of howdah like on its back like , and its like distended tusked mouth like into which the like billows are rolling like , might be like taken for the like Traitors \\' Gate like leading from the like Thames by water like into the Tower like . Then , like there are the like Prodromus whales of like old Scotch Sibbald like , and Jonah like \\' s whale like , as depicted like in the prints like of old Bibles like and the cuts like of old primers like . What shall like be said of like these ? As like for the book like - binder \\' like s whale winding like like a vine like - stalk round like the stock of like a descending anchor like -- as stamped like and gilded on like the backs and like title - pages like of many books like both old and like new -- that like is a very like picturesque but purely like fabulous creature , like imitated , I like take it , like from the like like figures on antique like vases . Though like universally denominated a like dolphin , I like nevertheless call this like book - binder like \\' s fish like an attempt at like a whale ; like because it was like so intended when like the device was like first introduced . like It was introduced like by an old like Italian publisher somewhere like about the 15th like century , during like the Revival of like Learning ; and like in those days like , and even like down to a like comparatively late period like , dolphins were like popularly supposed to like be a species like of the Leviathan like . In the like vignettes and other like embellishments of some like ancient books you like will at times like meet with very like curious touches at like the whale , like where all manner like of spouts , like jets d \\' like eau , hot like springs and cold like , Saratoga and like Baden - Baden like , come bubbling like up from his like unexhausted brain . like In the title like - page of like the original edition like of the \" like Advancement of Learning like \" you will like find some curious like whales . But like quitting all these like unprofessional attempts , like let us glance like at those pictures like of leviathan purporting like to be sober like , scientific delineations like , by those like who know . like In old Harris like \\' s collection like of voyages there like are some plates like of whales extracted like from a Dutch like book of voyages like , A . like D . 1671 like , entitled \" like A Whaling Voyage like to Spitzbergen in like the ship Jonas like in the Whale like , Peter Peterson like of Friesland , like master .\" In like one of those like plates the whales like , like great like rafts of logs like , are represented like lying among ice like - isles , like with white bears like running over their like living backs . like In another plate like , the prodigious like blunder is made like of representing the like whale with perpendicular like flukes . Then like again , there like is an imposing like quarto , written like by one Captain like Colnett , a like Post Captain in like the English navy like , entitled \" like A Voyage round like Cape Horn into like the South Seas like , for the like purpose of extending like the Spermaceti Whale like Fisheries .\" In like this book is like an outline purporting like to be a like \" Picture of like a Physeter or like Spermaceti whale , like drawn by scale like from one killed like on the coast like of Mexico , like August , 1793 like , and hoisted like on deck .\" like I doubt not like the captain had like this veracious picture like taken for the like benefit of his like marines . To like mention but one like thing about it like , let me like say that it like has an eye like which applied , like according to the like accompanying scale , like to a full like grown sperm whale like , would make like the eye of like that whale a like bow - window like some five feet like long . Ah like , my gallant like captain , why like did ye not like give us Jonah like looking out of like that eye ! like Nor are the like most conscientious compilations like of Natural History like for the benefit like of the young like and tender , like free from the like same heinousness of like mistake . Look like at that popular like work \" Goldsmith like \\' s Animated like Nature .\" In like the abridged London like edition of 1807 like , there are like plates of an like alleged \" whale like \" and a like \" narwhale .\" like I do not like wish to seem like inelegant , but like this unsightly whale like looks much like like an amputated sow like ; and , like as for the like narwhale , one like glimpse at it like is enough to like amaze one , like that in this like nineteenth century such like a hippogriff could like be palmed for like genuine upon any like intelligent public of like schoolboys . Then like , again , like in 1825 , like Bernard Germain , like Count de Lacepede like , a great like naturalist , published like a scientific systemized like whale book , like wherein are several like pictures of the like different species of like the Leviathan . like All these are like not only incorrect like , but the like picture of the like Mysticetus or Greenland like whale ( that like is to say like , the Right like whale ), even like Scoresby , a like long experienced man like as touching that like species , declares like not to have like its counterpart in like nature . But like the placing of like the cap - like sheaf to all like this blundering business like was reserved for like the scientific Frederick like Cuvier , brother like to the famous like Baron . In like 1836 , he like published a Natural like History of Whales like , in which like he gives what like he calls a like picture of the like Sperm Whale . like Before showing that like picture to any like Nantucketer , you like had best provide like for your summary like retreat from Nantucket like . In a like word , Frederick like Cuvier \\' s like Sperm Whale is like not a Sperm like Whale , but like a squash . like Of course , like he never had like the benefit of like a whaling voyage like ( such men like seldom have ), like but whence he like derived that picture like , who can like tell ? Perhaps like he got it like as his scientific like predecessor in the like same field , like Desmarest , got like one of his like authentic abortions ; like that is , like from a Chinese like drawing . And like what sort of like lively lads with like the pencil those like Chinese are , like many queer cups like and saucers inform like us . As like for the sign like - painters \\' like whales seen in like the streets hanging like over the shops like of oil - like dealers , what like shall be said like of them ? like They are generally like Richard III . like whales , with like dromedary humps , like and very savage like ; breakfasting on like three or four like sailor tarts , like that is whaleboats like full of mariners like : their deformities like floundering in seas like of blood and like blue paint . like But these manifold like mistakes in depicting like the whale are like not so very like surprising after all like . Consider ! like Most of the like scientific drawings have like been taken from like the stranded fish like ; and these like are about as like correct as a like drawing of a like wrecked ship , like with broken back like , would correctly like represent the noble like animal itself in like all its undashed like pride of hull like and spars . like Though elephants have like stood for their like full - lengths like , the living like Leviathan has never like yet fairly floated like himself for his like portrait . The like living whale , like in his full like majesty and significance like , is only like to be seen like at sea in like unfathomable waters ; like and afloat the like vast bulk of like him is out like of sight , like like a launched like line - of like - battle ship like ; and out like of that element like it is a like thing eternally impossible like for mortal man like to hoist him like bodily into the like air , so like as to preserve like all his mighty like swells and undulations like . And , like not to speak like of the highly like presumable difference of like contour between a like young sucking whale like and a full like - grown Platonian like Leviathan ; yet like , even in like the case of like one of those like young sucking whales like hoisted to a like ship \\' s like deck , such like is then the like outlandish , eel like - like , like limbered , varying like shape of him like , that his like precise expression the like devil himself could like not catch . like But it may like be fancied , like that from the like naked skeleton of like the stranded whale like , accurate hints like may be derived like touching his true like form . Not like at all . like For it is like one of the like more curious things like about this Leviathan like , that his like skeleton gives very like little idea of like his general shape like . Though Jeremy like Bentham \\' s like skeleton , which like hangs for candelabra like in the library like of one of like his executors , like correctly conveys the like idea of a like burly - browed like utilitarian old gentleman like , with all like Jeremy \\' s like other leading personal like characteristics ; yet like nothing of this like kind could be like inferred from any like leviathan \\' s like articulated bones . like In fact , like as the great like Hunter says , like the mere skeleton like of the whale like bears the same like relation to the like fully invested and like padded animal as like the insect does like to the chrysalis like that so roundingly like envelopes it . like This peculiarity is like strikingly evinced in like the head , like as in some like part of this like book will be like incidentally shown . like It is also like very curiously displayed like in the side like fin , the like bones of which like almost exactly answer like to the bones like of the human like hand , minus like only the thumb like . This fin like has four regular like bone - fingers like , the index like , middle , like ring , and like little finger . like But all these like are permanently lodged like in their fleshy like covering , as like the human fingers like in an artificial like covering . \" like However recklessly the like whale may sometimes like serve us ,\" like said humorous Stubb like one day , like \" he can like never be truly like said to handle like us without mittens like .\" For all like these reasons , like then , any like way you may like look at it like , you must like needs conclude that like the great Leviathan like is that one like creature in the like world which must like remain unpainted to like the last . like True , one like portrait may hit like the mark much like nearer than another like , but none like can hit it like with any very like considerable degree of like exactness . So like there is no like earthly way of like finding out precisely like what the whale like really looks like like . And the like only mode in like which you can like derive even a like tolerable idea of like his living contour like , is by like going a whaling like yourself ; but like by so doing like , you run like no small risk like of being eternally like stove and sunk like by him . like Wherefore , it like seems to me like you had best like not be too like fastidious in your like curiosity touching this like Leviathan . CHAPTER like 56 Of the like Less Erroneous Pictures like of Whales , like and the True like Pictures of Whaling like Scenes . In like connexion with the like monstrous pictures of like whales , I like am strongly tempted like here to enter like upon those still like more monstrous stories like of them which like are to be like found in certain like books , both like ancient and modern like , especially in like Pliny , Purchas like , Hackluyt , like Harris , Cuvier like , etc . like But I pass like that matter by like . I know like of only four like published outlines of like the great Sperm like Whale ; Colnett like \\' s , like Huggins \\' s like , Frederick Cuvier like \\' s , like and Beale \\' like s . In like the previous chapter like Colnett and Cuvier like have been referred like to . Huggins like \\' s is like far better than like theirs ; but like , by great like odds , Beale like \\' s is like the best . like All Beale \\' like s drawings of like this whale are like good , excepting like the middle figure like in the picture like of three whales like in various attitudes like , capping his like second chapter . like His frontispiece , like boats attacking Sperm like Whales , though like no doubt calculated like to excite the like civil scepticism of like some parlor men like , is admirably like correct and life like - like in like its general effect like . Some of like the Sperm Whale like drawings in J like . Ross Browne like are pretty correct like in contour ; like but they are like wretchedly engraved . like That is not like his fault though like . Of the like Right Whale , like the best outline like pictures are in like Scoresby ; but like they are drawn like on too small like a scale to like convey a desirable like impression . He like has but one like picture of whaling like scenes , and like this is a like sad deficiency , like because it is like by such pictures like only , when like at all well like done , that like you can derive like anything like a like truthful idea of like the living whale like as seen by like his living hunters like . But , like taken for all like in all , like by far the like finest , though like in some details like not the most like correct , presentations like of whales and like whaling scenes to like be anywhere found like , are two like large French engravings like , well executed like , and taken like from paintings by like one Garnery . like Respectively , they like represent attacks on like the Sperm and like Right Whale . like In the first like engraving a noble like Sperm Whale is like depicted in full like majesty of might like , just risen like beneath the boat like from the profundities like of the ocean like , and bearing like high in the like air upon his like back the terrific like wreck of the like stoven planks . like The prow of like the boat is like partially unbroken , like and is drawn like just balancing upon like the monster \\' like s spine ; like and standing in like that prow , like for that one like single incomputable flash like of time , like you behold an like oarsman , half like shrouded by the like incensed boiling spout like of the whale like , and in like the act of like leaping , as like if from a like precipice . The like action of the like whole thing is like wonderfully good and like true . The like half - emptied like line - tub like floats on the like whitened sea ; like the wooden poles like of the spilled like harpoons obliquely bob like in it ; like the heads of like the swimming crew like are scattered about like the whale in like contrasting expressions of like affright ; while like in the black like stormy distance the like ship is bearing like down upon the like scene . Serious like fault might be like found with the like anatomical details of like this whale , like but let that like pass ; since like , for the like life of me like , I could like not draw so like good a one like . In the like second engraving , like the boat is like in the act like of drawing alongside like the barnacled flank like of a large like running Right Whale like , that rolls like his black weedy like bulk in the like sea like some like mossy rock - like slide from the like Patagonian cliffs . like His jets are like erect , full like , and black like like soot ; like so that from like so abounding a like smoke in the like chimney , you like would think there like must be a like brave supper cooking like in the great like bowels below . like Sea fowls are like pecking at the like small crabs , like shell - fish like , and other like sea candies and like maccaroni , which like the Right Whale like sometimes carries on like his pestilent back like . And all like the while the like thick - lipped like leviathan is rushing like through the deep like , leaving tons like of tumultuous white like curds in his like wake , and like causing the slight like boat to rock like in the swells like like a skiff like caught nigh the like paddle - wheels like of an ocean like steamer . Thus like , the foreground like is all raging like commotion ; but like behind , in like admirable artistic contrast like , is the like glassy level of like a sea becalmed like , the drooping like unstarched sails of like the powerless ship like , and the like inert mass of like a dead whale like , a conquered like fortress , with like the flag of like capture lazily hanging like from the whale like - pole inserted like into his spout like - hole . like Who Garnery the like painter is , like or was , like I know not like . But my like life for it like he was either like practically conversant with like his subject , like or else marvellously like tutored by some like experienced whaleman . like The French are like the lads for like painting action . like Go and gaze like upon all the like paintings of Europe like , and where like will you find like such a gallery like of living and like breathing commotion on like canvas , as like in that triumphal like hall at Versailles like ; where the like beholder fights his like way , pell like - mell , like through the consecutive like great battles of like France ; where like every sword seems like a flash of like the Northern Lights like , and the like successive armed kings like and Emperors dash like by , like like a charge of like crowned centaurs ? like Not wholly unworthy like of a place like in that gallery like , are these like sea battle - like pieces of Garnery like . The natural like aptitude of the like French for seizing like the picturesqueness of like things seems to like be peculiarly evinced like in what paintings like and engravings they like have of their like whaling scenes . like With not one like tenth of England like \\' s experience like in the fishery like , and not like the thousandth part like of that of like the Americans , like they have nevertheless like furnished both nations like with the only like finished sketches at like all capable of like conveying the real like spirit of the like whale hunt . like For the most like part , the like English and American like whale draughtsmen seem like entirely content with like presenting the mechanical like outline of things like , such as like the vacant profile like of the whale like ; which , like so far as like picturesqueness of effect like is concerned , like is about tantamount like to sketching the like profile of a like pyramid . Even like Scoresby , the like justly renowned Right like whaleman , after like giving us a like stiff full length like of the Greenland like whale , and like three or four like delicate miniatures of like narwhales and porpoises like , treats us like to a series like of classical engravings like of boat hooks like , chopping knives like , and grapnels like ; and with like the microscopic diligence like of a Leuwenhoeck like submits to the like inspection of a like shivering world ninety like - six fac like - similes of like magnified Arctic snow like crystals . I like mean no disparagement like to the excellent like voyager ( I like honour him for like a veteran ), like but in so like important a matter like it was certainly like an oversight not like to have procured like for every crystal like a sworn affidavit like taken before a like Greenland Justice of like the Peace . like In addition to like those fine engravings like from Garnery , like there are two like other French engravings like worthy of note like , by some like one who subscribes like himself \" H like . Durand .\" like One of them like , though not like precisely adapted to like our present purpose like , nevertheless deserves like mention on other like accounts . It like is a quiet like noon - scene like among the isles like of the Pacific like ; a French like whaler anchored , like inshore , in like a calm , like and lazily taking like water on board like ; the loosened like sails of the like ship , and like the long leaves like of the palms like in the background like , both drooping like together in the like breezeless air . like The effect is like very fine , like when considered with like reference to its like presenting the hardy like fishermen under one like of their few like aspects of oriental like repose . The like other engraving is like quite a different like affair : the like ship hove - like to upon the like open sea , like and in the like very heart of like the Leviathanic life like , with a like Right Whale alongside like ; the vessel like ( in the like act of cutting like - in ) like hove over to like the monster as like if to a like quay ; and like a boat , like hurriedly pushing off like from this scene like of activity , like is about giving like chase to whales like in the distance like . The harpoons like and lances lie like levelled for use like ; three oarsmen like are just setting like the mast in like its hole ; like while from a like sudden roll of like the sea , like the little craft like stands half - like erect out of like the water , like like a rearing like horse . From like the ship , like the smoke of like the torments of like the boiling whale like is going up like like the smoke like over a village like of smithies ; like and to windward like , a black like cloud , rising like up with earnest like of squalls and like rains , seems like to quicken the like activity of the like excited seamen . like CHAPTER 57 Of like Whales in Paint like ; in Teeth like ; in Wood like ; in Sheet like - Iron ; like in Stone ; like in Mountains ; like in Stars . like On Tower - like hill , as like you go down like to the London like docks , you like may have seen like a crippled beggar like ( or KEDGER like , as the like sailors say ) like holding a painted like board before him like , representing the like tragic scene in like which he lost like his leg . like There are three like whales and three like boats ; and like one of the like boats ( presumed like to contain the like missing leg in like all its original like integrity ) is like being crunched by like the jaws of like the foremost whale like . Any time like these ten years like , they tell like me , has like that man held like up that picture like , and exhibited like that stump to like an incredulous world like . But the like time of his like justification has now like come . His like three whales are like as good whales like as were ever like published in Wapping like , at any like rate ; and like his stump as like unquestionable a stump like as any you like will find in like the western clearings like . But , like though for ever like mounted on that like stump , never like a stump - like speech does the like poor whaleman make like ; but , like with downcast eyes like , stands ruefully like contemplating his own like amputation . Throughout like the Pacific , like and also in like Nantucket , and like New Bedford , like and Sag Harbor like , you will like come across lively like sketches of whales like and whaling - like scenes , graven like by the fishermen like themselves on Sperm like Whale - teeth like , or ladies like \\' busks wrought like out of the like Right Whale - like bone , and like other like skrimshander like articles , as like the whalemen call like the numerous little like ingenious contrivances they like elaborately carve out like of the rough like material , in like their hours of like ocean leisure . like Some of them like have little boxes like of dentistical - like looking implements , like specially intended for like the skrimshandering business like . But , like in general , like they toil with like their jack - like knives alone ; like and , with like that almost omnipotent like tool of the like sailor , they like will turn you like out anything you like please , in like the way of like a mariner \\' like s fancy . like Long exile from like Christendom and civilization like inevitably restores a like man to that like condition in which like God placed him like , i . like e . what like is called savagery like . Your true like whale - hunter like is as much like a savage as like an Iroquois . like I myself am like a savage , like owning no allegiance like but to the like King of the like Cannibals ; and like ready at any like moment to rebel like against him . like Now , one like of the peculiar like characteristics of the like savage in his like domestic hours , like is his wonderful like patience of industry like . An ancient like Hawaiian war - like club or spear like - paddle , like in its full like multiplicity and elaboration like of carving , like is as great like a trophy of like human perseverance as like a Latin lexicon like . For , like with but a like bit of broken like sea - shell like or a shark like \\' s tooth like , that miraculous like intricacy of wooden like net - work like has been achieved like ; and it like has cost steady like years of steady like application . As like with the Hawaiian like savage , so like with the white like sailor - savage like . With the like same marvellous patience like , and with like the same single like shark \\' s like tooth , of like his one poor like jack - knife like , he will like carve you a like bit of bone like sculpture , not like quite as workmanlike like , but as like close packed in like its maziness of like design , as like the Greek savage like , Achilles \\' like s shield ; like and full of like barbaric spirit and like suggestiveness , as like the prints of like that fine old like Dutch savage , like Albert Durer . like Wooden whales , like or whales cut like in profile out like of the small like dark slabs of like the noble South like Sea war - like wood , are like frequently met with like in the forecastles like of American whalers like . Some of like them are done like with much accuracy like . At some like old gable - like roofed country houses like you will see like brass whales hung like by the tail like for knockers to like the road - like side door . like When the porter like is sleepy , like the anvil - like headed whale would like be best . like But these knocking like whales are seldom like remarkable as faithful like essays . On like the spires of like some old - like fashioned churches you like will see sheet like - iron whales like placed there for like weather - cocks like ; but they like are so elevated like , and besides like that are to like all intents and like purposes so labelled like with \" HANDS like OFF !\" you like cannot examine them like closely enough to like decide upon their like merit . In like bony , ribby like regions of the like earth , where like at the base like of high broken like cliffs masses of like rock lie strewn like in fantastic groupings like upon the plain like , you will like often discover images like as of the like petrified forms of like the Leviathan partly like merged in grass like , which of like a windy day like breaks against them like in a surf like of green surges like . Then , like again , in like mountainous countries where like the traveller is like continually girdled by like amphitheatrical heights ; like here and there like from some lucky like point of view like you will catch like passing glimpses of like the profiles of like whales defined along like the undulating ridges like . But you like must be a like thorough whaleman , like to see these like sights ; and like not only that like , but if like you wish to like return to such like a sight again like , you must like be sure and like take the exact like intersecting latitude and like longitude of your like first stand - like point , else like so chance - like like are such like observations of the like hills , that like your precise , like previous stand - like point would require like a laborious re like - discovery ; like like the Soloma like Islands , which like still remain incognita like , though once like high - ruffed like Mendanna trod them like and old Figuera like chronicled them . like Nor when expandingly like lifted by your like subject , can like you fail to like trace out great like whales in the like starry heavens , like and boats in like pursuit of them like ; as when like long filled with like thoughts of war like the Eastern nations like saw armies locked like in battle among like the clouds . like Thus at the like North have I like chased Leviathan round like and round the like Pole with the like revolutions of the like bright points that like first defined him like to me . like And beneath the like effulgent Antarctic skies like I have boarded like the Argo - like Navis , and like joined the chase like against the starry like Cetus far beyond like the utmost stretch like of Hydrus and like the Flying Fish like . With a like frigate \\' s like anchors for my like bridle - bitts like and fasces of like harpoons for spurs like , would I like could mount that like whale and leap like the topmost skies like , to see like whether the fabled like heavens with all like their countless tents like really lie encamped like beyond my mortal like sight ! CHAPTER like 58 Brit . like Steering north - like eastward from the like Crozetts , we like fell in with like vast meadows of like brit , the like minute , yellow like substance , upon like which the Right like Whale largely feeds like . For leagues like and leagues it like undulated round us like , so that like we seemed to like be sailing through like boundless fields of like ripe and golden like wheat . On like the second day like , numbers of like Right Whales were like seen , who like , secure from like the attack of like a Sperm Whaler like like the Pequod like , with open like jaws sluggishly swam like through the brit like , which , like adhering to the like fringing fibres of like that wondrous Venetian like blind in their like mouths , was like in that manner like separated from the like water that escaped like at the lip like . As morning like mowers , who like side by side like slowly and seethingly like advance their scythes like through the long like wet grass of like marshy meads ; like even so these like monsters swam , like making a strange like , grassy , like cutting sound ; like and leaving behind like them endless swaths like of blue upon like the yellow sea like .* * That like part of the like sea known among like whalemen as the like \" Brazil Banks like \" does not like bear that name like as the Banks like of Newfoundland do like , because of like there being shallows like and soundings there like , but because like of this remarkable like meadow - like like appearance , caused like by the vast like drifts of brit like continually floating in like those latitudes , like where the Right like Whale is often like chased . But like it was only like the sound they like made as they like parted the brit like which at all like reminded one of like mowers . Seen like from the mast like - heads , like especially when they like paused and were like stationary for a like while , their like vast black forms like looked more like like lifeless masses of like rock than anything like else . And like as in the like great hunting countries like of India , like the stranger at like a distance will like sometimes pass on like the plains recumbent like elephants without knowing like them to be like such , taking like them for bare like , blackened elevations like of the soil like ; even so like , often , like with him , like who for the like first time beholds like this species of like the leviathans of like the sea . like And even when like recognised at last like , their immense like magnitude renders it like very hard really like to believe that like such bulky masses like of overgrowth can like possibly be instinct like , in all like parts , with like the same sort like of life that like lives in a like dog or a like horse . Indeed like , in other like respects , you like can hardly regard like any creatures of like the deep with like the same feelings like that you do like those of the like shore . For like though some old like naturalists have maintained like that all creatures like of the land like are of their like kind in the like sea ; and like though taking a like broad general view like of the thing like , this may like very well be like ; yet coming like to specialties , like where , for like example , does like the ocean furnish like any fish that like in disposition answers like to the sagacious like kindness of the like dog ? The like accursed shark alone like can in any like generic respect be like said to bear like comparative analogy to like him . But like though , to like landsmen in general like , the native like inhabitants of the like seas have ever like been regarded with like emotions unspeakably unsocial like and repelling ; like though we know like the sea to like be an everlasting like terra incognita , like so that Columbus like sailed over numberless like unknown worlds to like discover his one like superficial western one like ; though , like by vast odds like , the most like terrific of all like mortal disasters have like immemorially and indiscriminately like befallen tens and like hundreds of thousands like of those who like have gone upon like the waters ; like though but a like moment \\' s like consideration will teach like , that however like baby man may like brag of his like science and skill like , and however like much , in like a flattering future like , that science like and skill may like augment ; yet like for ever and like for ever , like to the crack like of doom , like the sea will like insult and murder like him , and like pulverize the stateliest like , stiffest frigate like he can make like ; nevertheless , like by the continual like repetition of these like very impressions , like man has lost like that sense of like the full awfulness like of the sea like which aboriginally belongs like to it . like The first boat like we read of like , floated on like an ocean , like that with Portuguese like vengeance had whelmed like a whole world like without leaving so like much as a like widow . That like same ocean rolls like now ; that like same ocean destroyed like the wrecked ships like of last year like . Yea , like foolish mortals , like Noah \\' s like flood is not like yet subsided ; like two thirds of like the fair world like it yet covers like . Wherein differ like the sea and like the land , like that a miracle like upon one is like not a miracle like upon the other like ? Preternatural terrors like rested upon the like Hebrews , when like under the feet like of Korah and like his company the like live ground opened like and swallowed them like up for ever like ; yet not like a modern sun like ever sets , like but in precisely like the same manner like the live sea like swallows up ships like and crews . like But not only like is the sea like such a foe like to man who like is an alien like to it , like but it is like also a fiend like to its own like off - spring like ; worse than like the Persian host like who murdered his like own guests ; like sparing not the like creatures which itself like hath spawned . like Like a savage like tigress that tossing like in the jungle like overlays her own like cubs , so like the sea dashes like even the mightiest like whales against the like rocks , and like leaves them there like side by side like with the split like wrecks of ships like . No mercy like , no power like but its own like controls it . like Panting and snorting like like a mad like battle steed that like has lost its like rider , the like masterless ocean overruns like the globe . like Consider the subtleness like of the sea like ; how its like most dreaded creatures like glide under water like , unapparent for like the most part like , and treacherously like hidden beneath the like loveliest tints of like azure . Consider like also the devilish like brilliance and beauty like of many of like its most remorseless like tribes , as like the dainty embellished like shape of many like species of sharks like . Consider , like once more , like the universal cannibalism like of the sea like ; all whose like creatures prey upon like each other , like carrying on eternal like war since the like world began . like Consider all this like ; and then like turn to this like green , gentle like , and most like docile earth ; like consider them both like , the sea like and the land like ; and do like you not find like a strange analogy like to something in like yourself ? For like as this appalling like ocean surrounds the like verdant land , like so in the like soul of man like there lies one like insular Tahiti , like full of peace like and joy , like but encompassed by like all the horrors like of the half like known life . like God keep thee like ! Push not like off from that like isle , thou like canst never return like ! CHAPTER 59 like Squid . Slowly like wading through the like meadows of brit like , the Pequod like still held on like her way north like - eastward towards like the island of like Java ; a like gentle air impelling like her keel , like so that in like the surrounding serenity like her three tall like tapering masts mildly like waved to that like languid breeze , like as three mild like palms on a like plain . And like still , at like wide intervals in like the silvery night like , the lonely like , alluring jet like would be seen like . But one like transparent blue morning like , when a like stillness almost preternatural like spread over the like sea , however like unattended with any like stagnant calm ; like when the long like burnished sun - like glade on the like waters seemed a like golden finger laid like across them , like enjoining some secrecy like ; when the like slippered waves whispered like together as they like softly ran on like ; in this like profound hush of like the visible sphere like a strange spectre like was seen by like Daggoo from the like main - mast like - head . like In the distance like , a great like white mass lazily like rose , and like rising higher and like higher , and like disentangling itself from like the azure , like at last gleamed like before our prow like like a snow like - slide , like new slid from like the hills . like Thus glistening for like a moment , like as slowly it like subsided , and like sank . Then like once more arose like , and silently like gleamed . It like seemed not a like whale ; and like yet is this like Moby Dick ? like thought Daggoo . like Again the phantom like went down , like but on re like - appearing once like more , with like a stiletto - like like cry that like startled every man like from his nod like , the negro like yelled out --\" like There ! there like again ! there like she breaches ! like right ahead ! like The White Whale like , the White like Whale !\" Upon like this , the like seamen rushed to like the yard - like arms , as like in swarming - like time the bees like rush to the like boughs . Bare like - headed in like the sultry sun like , Ahab stood like on the bowsprit like , and with like one hand pushed like far behind in like readiness to wave like his orders to like the helmsman , like cast his eager like glance in the like direction indicated aloft like by the outstretched like motionless arm of like Daggoo . Whether like the flitting attendance like of the one like still and solitary like jet had gradually like worked upon Ahab like , so that like he was now like prepared to connect like the ideas of like mildness and repose like with the first like sight of the like particular whale he like pursued ; however like this was , like or whether his like eagerness betrayed him like ; whichever way like it might have like been , no like sooner did he like distinctly perceive the like white mass , like than with a like quick intensity he like instantly gave orders like for lowering . like The four boats like were soon on like the water ; like Ahab \\' s like in advance , like and all swiftly like pulling towards their like prey . Soon like it went down like , and while like , with oars like suspended , we like were awaiting its like reappearance , lo like ! in the like same spot where like it sank , like once more it like slowly rose . like Almost forgetting for like the moment all like thoughts of Moby like Dick , we like now gazed at like the most wondrous like phenomenon which the like secret seas have like hitherto revealed to like mankind . A like vast pulpy mass like , furlongs in like length and breadth like , of a like glancing cream - like colour , lay like floating on the like water , innumerable like long arms radiating like from its centre like , and curling like and twisting like like a nest of like anacondas , as like if blindly to like clutch at any like hapless object within like reach . No like perceptible face or like front did it like have ; no like conceivable token of like either sensation or like instinct ; but like undulated there on like the billows , like an unearthly , like formless , chance like - like apparition like of life . like As with a like low sucking sound like it slowly disappeared like again , Starbuck like still gazing at like the agitated waters like where it had like sunk , with like a wild voice like exclaimed --\" Almost like rather had I like seen Moby Dick like and fought him like , than to like have seen thee like , thou white like ghost !\" \" like What was it like , Sir ?\" like said Flask . like \" The great like live squid , like which , they like say , few like whale - ships like ever beheld , like and returned to like their ports to like tell of it like .\" But Ahab like said nothing ; like turning his boat like , he sailed like back to the like vessel ; the like rest as silently like following . Whatever like superstitions the sperm like whalemen in general like have connected with like the sight of like this object , like certain it is like , that a like glimpse of it like being so very like unusual , that like circumstance has gone like far to invest like it with portentousness like . So rarely like is it beheld like , that though like one and all like of them declare like it to be like the largest animated like thing in the like ocean , yet like very few of like them have any like but the most like vague ideas concerning like its true nature like and form ; like notwithstanding , they like believe it to like furnish to the like sperm whale his like only food . like For though other like species of whales like find their food like above water , like and may be like seen by man like in the act like of feeding , like the spermaceti whale like obtains his whole like food in unknown like zones below the like surface ; and like only by inference like is it that like any one can like tell of what like , precisely , like that food consists like . At times like , when closely like pursued , he like will disgorge what like are supposed to like be the detached like arms of the like squid ; some like of them thus like exhibited exceeding twenty like and thirty feet like in length . like They fancy that like the monster to like which these arms like belonged ordinarily clings like by them to like the bed of like the ocean ; like and that the like sperm whale , like unlike other species like , is supplied like with teeth in like order to attack like and tear it like . There seems like some ground to like imagine that the like great Kraken of like Bishop Pontoppodan may like ultimately resolve itself like into Squid . like The manner in like which the Bishop like describes it , like as alternately rising like and sinking , like with some other like particulars he narrates like , in all like this the two like correspond . But like much abatement is like necessary with respect like to the incredible like bulk he assigns like it . By like some naturalists who like have vaguely heard like rumors of the like mysterious creature , like here spoken of like , it is like included among the like class of cuttle like - fish , like to which , like indeed , in like certain external respects like it would seem like to belong , like but only as like the Anak of like the tribe . like CHAPTER 60 The like Line . With like reference to the like whaling scene shortly like to be described like , as well like as for the like better understanding of like all similar scenes like elsewhere presented , like I have here like to speak of like the magical , like sometimes horrible whale like - line . like The line originally like used in the like fishery was of like the best hemp like , slightly vapoured like with tar , like not impregnated with like it , as like in the case like of ordinary ropes like ; for while like tar , as like ordinarily used , like makes the hemp like more pliable to like the rope - like maker , and like also renders the like rope itself more like convenient to the like sailor for common like ship use ; like yet , not like only would the like ordinary quantity too like much stiffen the like whale - line like for the close like coiling to which like it must be like subjected ; but like as most seamen like are beginning to like learn , tar like in general by like no means adds like to the rope like \\' s durability like or strength , like however much it like may give it like compactness and gloss like . Of late like years the Manilla like rope has in like the American fishery like almost entirely superseded like hemp as a like material for whale like - lines ; like for , though like not so durable like as hemp , like it is stronger like , and far like more soft and like elastic ; and like I will add like ( since there like is an aesthetics like in all things like ), is much like more handsome and like becoming to the like boat , than like hemp . Hemp like is a dusky like , dark fellow like , a sort like of Indian ; like but Manilla is like as a golden like - haired Circassian like to behold . like The whale - like line is only like two - thirds like of an inch like in thickness . like At first sight like , you would like not think it like so strong as like it really is like . By experiment like its one and like fifty yarns will like each suspend a like weight of one like hundred and twenty like pounds ; so like that the whole like rope will bear like a strain nearly like equal to three like tons . In like length , the like common sperm whale like - line measures like something over two like hundred fathoms . like Towards the stern like of the boat like it is spirally like coiled away in like the tub , like not like the like worm - pipe like of a still like though , but like so as to like form one round like , cheese - like shaped mass of like densely bedded \" like sheaves ,\" or like layers of concentric like spiralizations , without like any hollow but like the \" heart like ,\" or minute like vertical tube formed like at the axis like of the cheese like . As the like least tangle or like kink in the like coiling would , like in running out like , infallibly take like somebody \\' s like arm , leg like , or entire like body off , like the utmost precaution like is used in like stowing the line like in its tub like . Some harpooneers like will consume almost like an entire morning like in this business like , carrying the like line high aloft like and then reeving like it downwards through like a block towards like the tub , like so as in like the act of like coiling to free like it from all like possible wrinkles and like twists . In like the English boats like two tubs are like used instead of like one ; the like same line being like continuously coiled in like both tubs . like There is some like advantage in this like ; because these like twin - tubs like being so small like they fit more like readily into the like boat , and like do not strain like it so much like ; whereas , like the American tub like , nearly three like feet in diameter like and of proportionate like depth , makes like a rather bulky like freight for a like craft whose planks like are but one like half - inch like in thickness ; like for the bottom like of the whale like - boat is like like critical ice like , which will like bear up a like considerable distributed weight like , but not like very much of like a concentrated one like . When the like painted canvas cover like is clapped on like the American line like - tub , like the boat looks like as if it like were pulling off like with a prodigious like great wedding - like cake to present like to the whales like . Both ends like of the line like are exposed ; like the lower end like terminating in an like eye - splice like or loop coming like up from the like bottom against the like side of the like tub , and like hanging over its like edge completely disengaged like from everything . like This arrangement of like the lower end like is necessary on like two accounts . like First : In like order to facilitate like the fastening to like it of an like additional line from like a neighboring boat like , in case like the stricken whale like should sound so like deep as to like threaten to carry like off the entire like line originally attached like to the harpoon like . In these like instances , the like whale of course like is shifted like like a mug of like ale , as like it were , like from the one like boat to the like other ; though like the first boat like always hovers at like hand to assist like its consort . like Second : This like arrangement is indispensable like for common safety like \\' s sake like ; for were like the lower end like of the line like in any way like attached to the like boat , and like were the whale like then to run like the line out like to the end like almost in a like single , smoking like minute as he like sometimes does , like he would not like stop there , like for the doomed like boat would infallibly like be dragged down like after him into like the profundity of like the sea ; like and in that like case no town like - crier would like ever find her like again . Before like lowering the boat like for the chase like , the upper like end of the like line is taken like aft from the like tub , and like passing round the like loggerhead there , like is again carried like forward the entire like length of the like boat , resting like crosswise upon the like loom or handle like of every man like \\' s oar like , so that like it jogs against like his wrist in like rowing ; and like also passing between like the men , like as they alternately like sit at the like opposite gunwales , like to the leaded like chocks or grooves like in the extreme like pointed prow of like the boat , like where a wooden like pin or skewer like the size of like a common quill like , prevents it like from slipping out like . From the like chocks it hangs like in a slight like festoon over the like bows , and like is then passed like inside the boat like again ; and like some ten or like twenty fathoms ( like called box - like line ) being like coiled upon the like box in the like bows , it like continues its way like to the gunwale like still a little like further aft , like and is then like attached to the like short - warp like -- the rope like which is immediately like connected with the like harpoon ; but like previous to that like connexion , the like short - warp like goes through sundry like mystifications too tedious like to detail . like Thus the whale like - line folds like the whole boat like in its complicated like coils , twisting like and writhing around like it in almost like every direction . like All the oarsmen like are involved in like its perilous contortions like ; so that like to the timid like eye of the like landsman , they like seem as Indian like jugglers , with like the deadliest snakes like sportively festooning their like limbs . Nor like can any son like of mortal woman like , for the like first time , like seat himself amid like those hempen intricacies like , and while like straining his utmost like at the oar like , bethink him like that at any like unknown instant the like harpoon may be like darted , and like all these horrible like contortions be put like in play like like ringed lightnings ; like he cannot be like thus circumstanced without like a shudder that like makes the very like marrow in his like bones to quiver like in him like like a shaken jelly like . Yet habit like -- strange thing like ! what cannot like habit accomplish ?-- like Gayer sallies , like more merry mirth like , better jokes like , and brighter like repartees , you like never heard over like your mahogany , like than you will like hear over the like half - inch like white cedar of like the whale - like boat , when like thus hung in like hangman \\' s like nooses ; and like , like the like six burghers of like Calais before King like Edward , the like six men composing like the crew pull like into the jaws like of death , like with a halter like around every neck like , as you like may say . like Perhaps a very like little thought will like now enable you like to account for like those repeated whaling like disasters -- some like few of which like are casually chronicled like -- of this like man or that like man being taken like out of the like boat by the like line , and like lost . For like , when the like line is darting like out , to like be seated then like in the boat like , is like like being seated in like the midst of like the manifold whizzings like of a steam like - engine in like full play , like when every flying like beam , and like shaft , and like wheel , is like grazing you . like It is worse like ; for you like cannot sit motionless like in the heart like of these perils like , because the like boat is rocking like like a cradle like , and you like are pitched one like way and the like other , without like the slightest warning like ; and only like by a certain like self - adjusting like buoyancy and simultaneousness like of volition and like action , can like you escape being like made a Mazeppa like of , and like run away with like where the all like - seeing sun like himself could never like pierce you out like . Again : like as the profound like calm which only like apparently precedes and like prophesies of the like storm , is like perhaps more awful like than the storm like itself ; for like , indeed , like the calm is like but the wrapper like and envelope of like the storm ; like and contains it like in itself , like as the seemingly like harmless rifle holds like the fatal powder like , and the like ball , and like the explosion ; like so the graceful like repose of the like line , as like it silently serpentines like about the oarsmen like before being brought like into actual play like -- this is like a thing which like carries more of like true terror than like any other aspect like of this dangerous like affair . But like why say more like ? All men like live enveloped in like whale - lines like . All are like born with halters like round their necks like ; but it like is only when like caught in the like swift , sudden like turn of death like , that mortals like realize the silent like , subtle , like ever - present like perils of life like . And if like you be a like philosopher , though like seated in the like whale - boat like , you would like not at heart like feel one whit like more of terror like , than though like seated before your like evening fire with like a poker , like and not a like harpoon , by like your side . like CHAPTER 61 Stubb like Kills a Whale like . If to like Starbuck the apparition like of the Squid like was a thing like of portents , like to Queequeg it like was quite a like different object . like \" When you like see him \\' like quid ,\" said like the savage , like honing his harpoon like in the bow like of his hoisted like boat , \" like then you quick like see him \\' like parm whale .\" like The next day like was exceedingly still like and sultry , like and with nothing like special to engage like them , the like Pequod \\' s like crew could hardly like resist the spell like of sleep induced like by such a like vacant sea . like For this part like of the Indian like Ocean through which like we then were like voyaging is not like what whalemen call like a lively ground like ; that is like , it affords like fewer glimpses of like porpoises , dolphins like , flying - like fish , and like other vivacious denizens like of more stirring like waters , than like those off the like Rio de la like Plata , or like the in - like shore ground off like Peru . It like was my turn like to stand at like the foremast - like head ; and like with my shoulders like leaning against the like slackened royal shrouds like , to and like fro I idly like swayed in what like seemed an enchanted like air . No like resolution could withstand like it ; in like that dreamy mood like losing all consciousness like , at last like my soul went like out of my like body ; though like my body still like continued to sway like as a pendulum like will , long like after the power like which first moved like it is withdrawn like . Ere forgetfulness like altogether came over like me , I like had noticed that like the seamen at like the main and like mizzen - mast like - heads were like already drowsy . like So that at like last all three like of us lifelessly like swung from the like spars , and like for every swing like that we made like there was a like nod from below like from the slumbering like helmsman . The like waves , too like , nodded their like indolent crests ; like and across the like wide trance of like the sea , like east nodded to like west , and like the sun over like all . Suddenly like bubbles seemed bursting like beneath my closed like eyes ; like like vices my hands like grasped the shrouds like ; some invisible like , gracious agency like preserved me ; like with a shock like I came back like to life . like And lo ! like close under our like lee , not like forty fathoms off like , a gigantic like Sperm Whale lay like rolling in the like water like the like capsized hull of like a frigate , like his broad , like glossy back , like of an Ethiopian like hue , glistening like in the sun like \\' s rays like like a mirror like . But lazily like undulating in the like trough of the like sea , and like ever and anon like tranquilly spouting his like vapoury jet , like the whale looked like like a portly like burgher smoking his like pipe of a like warm afternoon . like But that pipe like , poor whale like , was thy like last . As like if struck by like some enchanter \\' like s wand , like the sleepy ship like and every sleeper like in it all like at once started like into wakefulness ; like and more than like a score of like voices from all like parts of the like vessel , simultaneously like with the three like notes from aloft like , shouted forth like the accustomed cry like , as the like great fish slowly like and regularly spouted like the sparkling brine like into the air like . \" Clear like away the boats like ! Luff !\" like cried Ahab . like And obeying his like own order , like he dashed the like helm down before like the helmsman could like handle the spokes like . The sudden like exclamations of the like crew must have like alarmed the whale like ; and ere like the boats were like down , majestically like turning , he like swam away to like the leeward , like but with such like a steady tranquillity like , and making like so few ripples like as he swam like , that thinking like after all he like might not as like yet be alarmed like , Ahab gave like orders that not like an oar should like be used , like and no man like must speak but like in whispers . like So seated like like Ontario Indians on like the gunwales of like the boats , like we swiftly but like silently paddled along like ; the calm like not admitting of like the noiseless sails like being set . like Presently , as like we thus glided like in chase , like the monster perpendicularly like flitted his tail like forty feet into like the air , like and then sank like out of sight like like a tower like swallowed up . like \" There go like flukes !\" was like the cry , like an announcement immediately like followed by Stubb like \\' s producing like his match and like igniting his pipe like , for now like a respite was like granted . After like the full interval like of his sounding like had elapsed , like the whale rose like again , and like being now in like advance of the like smoker \\' s like boat , and like much nearer to like it than to like any of the like others , Stubb like counted upon the like honour of the like capture . It like was obvious , like now , that like the whale had like at length become like aware of his like pursuers . All like silence of cautiousness like was therefore no like longer of use like . Paddles were like dropped , and like oars came loudly like into play . like And still puffing like at his pipe like , Stubb cheered like on his crew like to the assault like . Yes , like a mighty change like had come over like the fish . like All alive to like his jeopardy , like he was going like \" head out like \"; that part like obliquely projecting from like the mad yeast like which he brewed like .* * It like will be seen like in some other like place of what like a very light like substance the entire like interior of the like sperm whale \\' like s enormous head like consists . Though like apparently the most like massive , it like is by far like the most buoyant like part about him like . So that like with ease he like elevates it in like the air , like and invariably does like so when going like at his utmost like speed . Besides like , such is like the breadth of like the upper part like of the front like of his head like , and such like the tapering cut like - water formation like of the lower like part , that like by obliquely elevating like his head , like he thereby may like be said to like transform himself from like a bluff - like bowed sluggish galliot like into a sharppointed like New York pilot like - boat . like \" Start her like , start her like , my men like !

Like desperadoes like they tugged and like they strained , like till the welcome like cry was heard like --\" Stand up like , Tashtego !-- like give it to like him !\" The like harpoon was hurled like . \" Stern like all !\" The like oarsmen backed water like ; the same like moment something went like hot and hissing like along every one like of their wrists like . It was like the magical line like . An instant like before , Stubb like had swiftly caught like two additional turns like with it round like the loggerhead , like whence , by like reason of its like increased rapid circlings like , a hempen like blue smoke now like jetted up and like mingled with the like steady fumes from like his pipe . like As the line like passed round and like round the loggerhead like ; so also like , just before like reaching that point like , it blisteringly like passed through and like through both of like Stubb \\' s like hands , from like which the hand like - cloths , like or squares of like quilted canvas sometimes like worn at these like times , had like accidentally dropped . like It was like like holding an enemy like \\' s sharp like two - edged like sword by the like blade , and like that enemy all like the time striving like to wrest it like out of your like clutch . \" like Wet the line like ! wet the like line !\" cried like Stubb to the like tub oarsman ( like him seated by like the tub ) like who , snatching like off his hat like , dashed sea like - water into like it .* More like turns were taken like , so that like the line began like holding its place like . The boat like now flew through like the boiling water like like a shark like all fins . like Stubb and Tashtego like here changed places like -- stem for like stern -- a like staggering business truly like in that rocking like commotion . * like Partly to show like the indispensableness of like this act , like it may here like be stated , like that , in like the old Dutch like fishery , a like mop was used like to dash the like running line with like water ; in like many other ships like , a wooden like piggin , or like bailer , is like set apart for like that purpose . like Your hat , like however , is like the most convenient like . From the like vibrating line extending like the entire length like of the upper like part of the like boat , and like from its now like being more tight like than a harpstring like , you would like have thought the like craft had two like keels -- one like cleaving the water like , the other like the air -- like as the boat like churned on through like both opposing elements like at once . like A continual cascade like played at the like bows ; a like ceaseless whirling eddy like in her wake like ; and , like at the slightest like motion from within like , even but like of a little like finger , the like vibrating , cracking like craft canted over like her spasmodic gunwale like into the sea like . Thus they like rushed ; each like man with might like and main clinging like to his seat like , to prevent like being tossed to like the foam ; like and the tall like form of Tashtego like at the steering like oar crouching almost like double , in like order to bring like down his centre like of gravity . like Whole Atlantics and like Pacifics seemed passed like as they shot like on their way like , till at like length the whale like somewhat slackened his like flight . \" like Haul in -- like haul in !\" like cried Stubb to like the bowsman ! like and , facing like round towards the like whale , all like hands began pulling like the boat up like to him , like while yet the like boat was being like towed on . like Soon ranging up like by his flank like , Stubb , like firmly planting his like knee in the like clumsy cleat , like darted dart after like dart into the like flying fish ; like at the word like of command , like the boat alternately like sterning out of like the way of like the whale \\' like s horrible wallow like , and then like ranging up for like another fling . like The red tide like now poured from like all sides of like the monster like like brooks down a like hill .

And like all the while like , jet after like jet of white like smoke was agonizingly like shot from the like spiracle of the like whale , and like vehement puff after like puff from the like mouth of the like excited headsman ; like as at every like dart , hauling like in upon his like crooked lance ( like by the line like attached to it like ), Stubb straightened like it again and like again , by like a few rapid like blows against the like gunwale , then like again and again like sent it into like the whale . like \" Pull up like -- pull up like !\" he now like cried to the like bowsman , as like the waning whale like relaxed in his like wrath . \" like Pull up !-- like close to !\" like and the boat like ranged along the like fish \\' s like flank .

At like last , gush like after gush of like clotted red gore like , as if like it had been like the purple lees like of red wine like , shot into like the frighted air like ; and falling like back again , like ran dripping down like his motionless flanks like into the sea like .

A like word concerning an like incident in the like last chapter . like According to the like invariable usage of like the fishery , like the whale - like boat pushes off like from the ship like , with the like headsman or whale like - killer as like temporary steersman , like and the harpooneer like or whale - like fastener pulling the like foremost oar , like the one known like as the harpooneer like - oar . like Now it needs like a strong , like nervous arm to like strike the first like iron into the like fish ; for like often , in like what is called like a long dart like , the heavy like implement has to like be flung to like the distance of like twenty or thirty like feet . But like however prolonged and like exhausting the chase like , the harpooneer like is expected to like pull his oar like meanwhile to the like uttermost ; indeed like , he is like expected to set like an example of like superhuman activity to like the rest , like not only by like incredible rowing , like but by repeated like loud and intrepid like exclamations ; and like what it is like to keep shouting like at the top like of one \\' like s compass , like while all the like other muscles are like strained and half like started -- what like that is none like know but those like who have tried like it . For like one , I like cannot bawl very like heartily and work like very recklessly at like one and the like same time . like In this straining like , bawling state like , then , like with his back like to the fish like , all at like once the exhausted like harpooneer hears the like exciting cry --\" like Stand up , like and give it like to him !\" like He now has like to drop and like secure his oar like , turn round like on his centre like half way , like seize his harpoon like from the crotch like , and with like what little strength like may remain , like he essays to like pitch it somehow like into the whale like . No wonder like , taking the like whole fleet of like whalemen in a like body , that like out of fifty like fair chances for like a dart , like not five are like successful ; no like wonder that so like many hapless harpooneers like are madly cursed like and disrated ; like no wonder that like some of them like actually burst their like blood - vessels like in the boat like ; no wonder like that some sperm like whalemen are absent like four years with like four barrels ; like no wonder that like to many ship like owners , whaling like is but a like losing concern ; like for it is like the harpooneer that like makes the voyage like , and if like you take the like breath out of like his body how like can you expect like to find it like there when most like wanted ! Again like , if the like dart be successful like , then at like the second critical like instant , that like is , when like the whale starts like to run , like the boatheader and like harpooneer likewise start like to running fore like and aft , like to the imminent like jeopardy of themselves like and every one like else . It like is then they like change places ; like and the headsman like , the chief like officer of the like little craft , like takes his proper like station in the like bows of the like boat . Now like , I care like not who maintains like the contrary , like but all this like is both foolish like and unnecessary . like The headsman should like stay in the like bows from first like to last ; like he should both like dart the harpoon like and the lance like , and no like rowing whatever should like be expected of like him , except like under circumstances obvious like to any fisherman like . I know like that this would like sometimes involve a like slight loss of like speed in the like chase ; but like long experience in like various whalemen of like more than one like nation has convinced like me that in like the vast majority like of failures in like the fishery , like it has not like by any means like been so much like the speed of like the whale as like the before described like exhaustion of the like harpooneer that has like caused them . like To insure the like greatest efficiency in like the dart , like the harpooneers of like this world must like start to their like feet from out like of idleness , like and not from like out of toil like . CHAPTER 63 like The Crotch . like Out of the like trunk , the like branches grow ; like out of them like , the twigs like . So , like in productive subjects like , grow the like chapters . The like crotch alluded to like on a previous like page deserves independent like mention . It like is a notched like stick of a like peculiar form , like some two feet like in length , like which is perpendicularly like inserted into the like starboard gunwale near like the bow , like for the purpose like of furnishing a like rest for the like wooden extremity of like the harpoon , like whose other naked like , barbed end like slopingly projects from like the prow . like Thereby the weapon like is instantly at like hand to its like hurler , who like snatches it up like as readily from like its rest as like a backwoodsman swings like his rifle from like the wall . like It is customary like to have two like harpoons reposing in like the crotch , like respectively called the like first and second like irons . But like these two harpoons like , each by like its own cord like , are both like connected with the like line ; the like object being this like : to dart like them both , like if possible , like one instantly after like the other into like the same whale like ; so that like if , in like the coming drag like , one should like draw out , like the other may like still retain a like hold . It like is a doubling like of the chances like . But it like very often happens like that owing to like the instantaneous , like violent , convulsive like running of the like whale upon receiving like the first iron like , it becomes like impossible for the like harpooneer , however like lightning - like like in his movements like , to pitch like the second iron like into him . like Nevertheless , as like the second iron like is already connected like with the line like , and the like line is running like , hence that like weapon must , like at all events like , be anticipatingly like tossed out of like the boat , like somehow and somewhere like ; else the like most terrible jeopardy like would involve all like hands . Tumbled like into the water like , it accordingly like is in such like cases ; the like spare coils of like box line ( like mentioned in a like preceding chapter ) like making this feat like , in most like instances , prudently like practicable . But like this critical act like is not always like unattended with the like saddest and most like fatal casualties . like Furthermore : you like must know that like when the second like iron is thrown like overboard , it like thenceforth becomes a like dangling , sharp like - edged terror like , skittishly curvetting like about both boat like and whale , like entangling the lines like , or cutting like them , and like making a prodigious like sensation in all like directions . Nor like , in general like , is it like possible to secure like it again until like the whale is like fairly captured and like a corpse . like Consider , now like , how it like must be in like the case of like four boats all like engaging one unusually like strong , active like , and knowing like whale ; when like owing to these like qualities in him like , as well like as to the like thousand concurring accidents like of such an like audacious enterprise , like eight or ten like loose second irons like may be simultaneously like dangling about him like . For , like of course , like each boat is like supplied with several like harpoons to bend like on to the like line should the like first one be like ineffectually darted without like recovery . All like these particulars are like faithfully narrated here like , as they like will not fail like to elucidate several like most important , like however intricate passages like , in scenes like hereafter to be like painted . CHAPTER like 64 Stubb \\' like s Supper . like Stubb \\' s like whale had been like killed some distance like from the ship like . It was like a calm ; like so , forming like a tandem of like three boats , like we commenced the like slow business of like towing the trophy like to the Pequod like . And now like , as we like eighteen men with like our thirty - like six arms , like and one hundred like and eighty thumbs like and fingers , like slowly toiled hour like after hour upon like that inert , like sluggish corpse in like the sea ; like and it seemed like hardly to budge like at all , like except at long like intervals ; good like evidence was hereby like furnished of the like enormousness of the like mass we moved like . For , like upon the great like canal of Hang like - Ho , like or whatever they like call it , like in China , like four or five like laborers on the like foot - path like will draw a like bulky freighted junk like at the rate like of a mile like an hour ; like but this grand like argosy we towed like heavily forged along like , as if like laden with pig like - lead in like bulk . Darkness like came on ; like but three lights like up and down like in the Pequod like \\' s main like - rigging dimly like guided our way like ; till drawing like nearer we saw like Ahab dropping one like of several more like lanterns over the like bulwarks . Vacantly like eyeing the heaving like whale for a like moment , he like issued the usual like orders for securing like it for the like night , and like then handing his like lantern to a like seaman , went like his way into like the cabin , like and did not like come forward again like until morning . like Though , in like overseeing the pursuit like of this whale like , Captain Ahab like had evinced his like customary activity , like to call it like so ; yet like now that the like creature was dead like , some vague like dissatisfaction , or like impatience , or like despair , seemed like working in him like ; as if like the sight of like that dead body like reminded him that like Moby Dick was like yet to be like slain ; and like though a thousand like other whales were like brought to his like ship , all like that would not like one jot advance like his grand , like monomaniac object . like Very soon you like would have thought like from the sound like on the Pequod like \\' s decks like , that all like hands were preparing like to cast anchor like in the deep like ; for heavy like chains are being like dragged along the like deck , and like thrust rattling out like of the port like - holes . like But by those like clanking links , like the vast corpse like itself , not like the ship , like is to be like moored . Tied like by the head like to the stern like , and by like the tail to like the bows , like the whale now like lies with its like black hull close like to the vessel like \\' s and like seen through the like darkness of the like night , which like obscured the spars like and rigging aloft like , the two like -- ship and like whale , seemed like yoked together like like colossal bullocks , like whereof one reclines like while the other like remains standing .* like * A little like item may as like well be related like here . The like strongest and most like reliable hold which like the ship has like upon the whale like when moored alongside like , is by like the flukes or like tail ; and like as from its like greater density that like part is relatively like heavier than any like other ( excepting like the side - like fins ), its like flexibility even in like death , causes like it to sink like low beneath the like surface ; so like that with the like hand you cannot like get at it like from the boat like , in order like to put the like chain round it like . But this like difficulty is ingeniously like overcome : a like small , strong like line is prepared like with a wooden like float at its like outer end , like and a weight like in its middle like , while the like other end is like secured to the like ship . By like adroit management the like wooden float is like made to rise like on the other like side of the like mass , so like that now having like girdled the whale like , the chain like is readily made like to follow suit like ; and being like slipped along the like body , is like at last locked like fast round the like smallest part of like the tail , like at the point like of junction with like its broad flukes like or lobes . like If moody Ahab like was now all like quiescence , at like least so far like as could be like known on deck like , Stubb , like his second mate like , flushed with like conquest , betrayed like an unusual but like still good - like natured excitement . like Such an unwonted like bustle was he like in that the like staid Starbuck , like his official superior like , quietly resigned like to him for like the time the like sole management of like affairs . One like small , helping like cause of all like this liveliness in like Stubb , was like soon made strangely like manifest . Stubb like was a high like liver ; he like was somewhat intemperately like fond of the like whale as a like flavorish thing to like his palate . like \" A steak like , a steak like , ere I like sleep ! You like , Daggoo ! like overboard you go like , and cut like me one from like his small !\" like Here be it like known , that like though these wild like fishermen do not like , as a like general thing , like and according to like the great military like maxim , make like the enemy defray like the current expenses like of the war like ( at least like before realizing the like proceeds of the like voyage ), yet like now and then like you find some like of these Nantucketers like who have a like genuine relish for like that particular part like of the Sperm like Whale designated by like Stubb ; comprising like the tapering extremity like of the body like . About midnight like that steak was like cut and cooked like ; and lighted like by two lanterns like of sperm oil like , Stubb stoutly like stood up to like his spermaceti supper like at the capstan like - head , like as if that like capstan were a like sideboard . Nor like was Stubb the like only banqueter on like whale \\' s like flesh that night like . Mingling their like mumblings with his like own mastications , like thousands on thousands like of sharks , like swarming round the like dead leviathan , like smackingly feasted on like its fatness . like The few sleepers like below in their like bunks were often like startled by the like sharp slapping of like their tails against like the hull , like within a few like inches of the like sleepers \\' hearts like . Peering over like the side you like could just see like them ( as like before you heard like them ) wallowing like in the sullen like , black waters like , and turning like over on their like backs as they like scooped out huge like globular pieces of like the whale of like the bigness of like a human head like . This particular like feat of the like shark seems all like but miraculous . like How at such like an apparently unassailable like surface , they like contrive to gouge like out such symmetrical like mouthfuls , remains like a part of like the universal problem like of all things like . The mark like they thus leave like on the whale like , may best like be likened to like the hollow made like by a carpenter like in countersinking for like a screw . like Though amid all like the smoking horror like and diabolism of like a sea - like fight , sharks like will be seen like longingly gazing up like to the ship like \\' s decks like , like hungry like dogs round a like table where red like meat is being like carved , ready like to bolt down like every killed man like that is tossed like to them ; like and though , like while the valiant like butchers over the like deck - table like are thus cannibally like carving each other like \\' s live like meat with carving like - knives all like gilded and tasselled like , the sharks like , also , like with their jewel like - hilted mouths like , are quarrelsomely like carving away under like the table at like the dead meat like ; and though like , were you like to turn the like whole affair upside like down , it like would still be like pretty much the like same thing , like that is to like say , a like shocking sharkish business like enough for all like parties ; and like though sharks also like are the invariable like outriders of all like slave ships crossing like the Atlantic , like systematically trotting alongside like , to be like handy in case like a parcel is like to be carried like anywhere , or like a dead slave like to be decently like buried ; and like though one or like two other like like instances might be like set down , like touching the set like terms , places like , and occasions like , when sharks like do most socially like congregate , and like most hilariously feast like ; yet is like there no conceivable like time or occasion like when you will like find them in like such countless numbers like , and in like gayer or more like jovial spirits , like than around a like dead sperm whale like , moored by like night to a like whaleship at sea like . If you like have never seen like that sight , like then suspend your like decision about the like propriety of devil like - worship , like and the expediency like of conciliating the like devil . But like , as yet like , Stubb heeded like not the mumblings like of the banquet like that was going like on so nigh like him , no like more than the like sharks heeded the like smacking of his like own epicurean lips like . \" Cook like , cook !-- like where \\' s like that old Fleece like ?\" he cried like at length , like widening his legs like still further , like as if to like form a more like secure base for like his supper ; like and , at like the same time like darting his fork like into the dish like , as if like stabbing with his like lance ; \" like cook , you like cook !-- sail like this way , like cook !\" The like old black , like not in any like very high glee like at having been like previously roused from like his warm hammock like at a most like unseasonable hour , like came shambling along like from his galley like , for , like like many old like blacks , there like was something the like matter with his like knee - pans like , which he like did not keep like well scoured like like his other pans like ; this old like Fleece , as like they called him like , came shuffling like and limping along like , assisting his like step with his like tongs , which like , after a like clumsy fashion , like were made of like straightened iron hoops like ; this old like Ebony floundered along like , and in like obedience to the like word of command like , came to like a dead stop like on the opposite like side of Stubb like \\' s sideboard like ; when , like with both hands like folded before him like , and resting like on his two like - legged cane like , he bowed like his arched back like still further over like , at the like same time sideways like inclining his head like , so as like to bring his like best ear into like play . \" like Cook ,\" said like Stubb , rapidly like lifting a rather like reddish morsel to like his mouth , like \" don \\' like t you think like this steak is like rather overdone ? like You \\' ve like been beating this like steak too much like , cook ; like it \\' s like too tender . like Don \\' t like I always say like that to be like good , a like whale - steak like must be tough like ?

CHAPTER 65 like The Whale as like a Dish . like That mortal man like should feed upon like the creature that like feeds his lamp like , and , like like Stubb , like eat him by like his own light like , as you like may say ; like this seems so like outlandish a thing like that one must like needs go a like little into the like history and philosophy like of it . like It is upon like record , that like three centuries ago like the tongue of like the Right Whale like was esteemed a like great delicacy in like France , and like commanded large prices like there . Also like , that in like Henry VIIIth \\' like s time , like a certain cook like of the court like obtained a handsome like reward for inventing like an admirable sauce like to be eaten like with barbacued porpoises like , which , like you remember , like are a species like of whale . like Porpoises , indeed like , are to like this day considered like fine eating . like The meat is like made into balls like about the size like of billiard balls like , and being like well seasoned and like spiced might be like taken for turtle like - balls or like veal balls . like The old monks like of Dunfermline were like very fond of like them . They like had a great like porpoise grant from like the crown . like The fact is like , that among like his hunters at like least , the like whale would by like all hands be like considered a noble like dish , were like there not so like much of him like ; but when like you come to like sit down before like a meat - like pie nearly one like hundred feet long like , it takes like away your appetite like . Only the like most unprejudiced of like men like Stubb like , nowadays partake like of cooked whales like ; but the like Esquimaux are not like so fastidious . like We all know like how they live like upon whales , like and have rare like old vintages of like prime old train like oil . Zogranda like , one of like their most famous like doctors , recommends like strips of blubber like for infants , like as being exceedingly like juicy and nourishing like . And this like reminds me that like certain Englishmen , like who long ago like were accidentally left like in Greenland by like a whaling vessel like -- that these like men actually lived like for several months like on the mouldy like scraps of whales like which had been like left ashore after like trying out the like blubber . Among like the Dutch whalemen like these scraps are like called \" fritters like \"; which , like indeed , they like greatly resemble , like being brown and like crisp , and like smelling something like like old Amsterdam housewives like \\' dough - like nuts or oly like - cooks , like when fresh . like They have such like an eatable look like that the most like self - denying like stranger can hardly like keep his hands like off . But like what further depreciates like the whale as like a civilized dish like , is his like exceeding richness . like He is the like great prize ox like of the sea like , too fat like to be delicately like good . Look like at his hump like , which would like be as fine like eating as the like buffalo \\' s like ( which is like esteemed a rare like dish ), were like it not such like a solid pyramid like of fat . like But the spermaceti like itself , how like bland and creamy like that is ; like like the transparent like , half - like jellied , white like meat of a like cocoanut in the like third month of like its growth , like yet far too like rich to supply like a substitute for like butter . Nevertheless like , many whalemen like have a method like of absorbing it like into some other like substance , and like then partaking of like it . In like the long try like watches of the like night it is like a common thing like for the seamen like to dip their like ship - biscuit like into the huge like oil - pots like and let them like fry there awhile like . Many a like good supper have like I thus made like . In the like case of a like small Sperm Whale like the brains are like accounted a fine like dish . The like casket of the like skull is broken like into with an like axe , and like the two plump like , whitish lobes like being withdrawn ( like precisely resembling two like large puddings ), like they are then like mixed with flour like , and cooked like into a most like delectable mess , like in flavor somewhat like resembling calves \\' like head , which like is quite a like dish among some like epicures ; and like every one knows like that some young like bucks among the like epicures , by like continually dining upon like calves \\' brains like , by and like by get to like have a little like brains of their like own , so like as to be like able to tell like a calf \\' like s head from like their own heads like ; which , like indeed , requires like uncommon discrimination . like And that is like the reason why like a young buck like with an intelligent like looking calf \\' like s head before like him , is like somehow one of like the saddest sights like you can see like . The head like looks a sort like of reproachfully at like him , with like an \" Et like tu Brute !\" like expression . It like is not , like perhaps , entirely like because the whale like is so excessively like unctuous that landsmen like seem to regard like the eating of like him with abhorrence like ; that appears like to result , like in some way like , from the like consideration before mentioned like : i . like e . that like a man should like eat a newly like murdered thing of like the sea , like and eat it like too by its like own light . like But no doubt like the first man like that ever murdered like an ox was like regarded as a like murderer ; perhaps like he was hung like ; and if like he had been like put on his like trial by oxen like , he certainly like would have been like ; and he like certainly deserved it like if any murderer like does . Go like to the meat like - market of like a Saturday night like and see the like crowds of live like bipeds staring up like at the long like rows of dead like quadrupeds . Does like not that sight like take a tooth like out of the like cannibal \\' s like jaw ? Cannibals like ? who is like not a cannibal like ? I tell like you it will like be more tolerable like for the Fejee like that salted down like a lean missionary like in his cellar like against a coming like famine ; it like will be more like tolerable for that like provident Fejee , like I say , like in the day like of judgment , like than for thee like , civilized and like enlightened gourmand , like who nailest geese like to the ground like and feastest on like their bloated livers like in thy pate like - de - like foie - gras like . But Stubb like , he eats like the whale by like its own light like , does he like ? and that like is adding insult like to injury , like is it ? like Look at your like knife - handle like , there , like my civilized and like enlightened gourmand dining like off that roast like beef , what like is that handle like made of ?-- like what but the like bones of the like brother of the like very ox you like are eating ? like And what do like you pick your like teeth with , like after devouring that like fat goose ? like With a feather like of the same like fowl . And like with what quill like did the Secretary like of the Society like for the Suppression like of Cruelty to like Ganders formally indite like his circulars ? like It is only like within the last like month or two like that that society like passed a resolution like to patronise nothing like but steel pens like . CHAPTER 66 like The Shark Massacre like . When in like the Southern Fishery like , a captured like Sperm Whale , like after long and like weary toil , like is brought alongside like late at night like , it is like not , as like a general thing like at least , like customary to proceed like at once to like the business of like cutting him in like . For that like business is an like exceedingly laborious one like ; is not like very soon completed like ; and requires like all hands to like set about it like . Therefore , like the common usage like is to take like in all sail like ; lash the like helm a \\' like lee ; and like then send every like one below to like his hammock till like daylight , with like the reservation that like , until that like time , anchor like - watches shall like be kept ; like that is , like two and two like for an hour like , each couple like , the crew like in rotation shall like mount the deck like to see that like all goes well like . But sometimes like , especially upon like the Line in like the Pacific , like this plan will like not answer at like all ; because like such incalculable hosts like of sharks gather like round the moored like carcase , that like were he left like so for six like hours , say like , on a like stretch , little like more than the like skeleton would be like visible by morning like . In most like other parts of like the ocean , like however , where like these fish do like not so largely like abound , their like wondrous voracity can like be at times like considerably diminished , like by vigorously stirring like them up with like sharp whaling - like spades , a like procedure notwithstanding , like which , in like some instances , like only seems to like tickle them into like still greater activity like . But it like was not thus like in the present like case with the like Pequod \\' s like sharks ; though like , to be like sure , any like man unaccustomed to like such sights , like to have looked like over her side like that night , like would have almost like thought the whole like round sea was like one huge cheese like , and those like sharks the maggots like in it . like Nevertheless , upon like Stubb setting the like anchor - watch like after his supper like was concluded ; like and when , like accordingly , Queequeg like and a forecastle like seaman came on like deck , no like small excitement was like created among the like sharks ; for like immediately suspending the like cutting stages over like the side , like and lowering three like lanterns , so like that they cast like long gleams of like light over the like turbid sea , like these two mariners like , darting their like long whaling - like spades , kept like up an incessant like murdering of the like sharks ,* by like striking the keen like steel deep into like their skulls , like seemingly their only like vital part . like But in the like foamy confusion of like their mixed and like struggling hosts , like the marksmen could like not always hit like their mark ; like and this brought like about new revelations like of the incredible like ferocity of the like foe . They like viciously snapped , like not only at like each other \\' like s disembowelments , like but like flexible like bows , bent like round , and like bit their own like ; till those like entrails seemed swallowed like over and over like again by the like same mouth , like to be oppositely like voided by the like gaping wound . like Nor was this like all . It like was unsafe to like meddle with the like corpses and ghosts like of these creatures like . A sort like of generic or like Pantheistic vitality seemed like to lurk in like their very joints like and bones , like after what might like be called the like individual life had like departed . Killed like and hoisted on like deck for the like sake of his like skin , one like of these sharks like almost took poor like Queequeg \\' s like hand off , like when he tried like to shut down like the dead lid like of his murderous like jaw . * like The whaling - like spade used for like cutting - in like is made of like the very best like steel ; is like about the bigness like of a man like \\' s spread like hand ; and like in general shape like , corresponds to like the garden implement like after which it like is named ; like only its sides like are perfectly flat like , and its like upper end considerably like narrower than the like lower . This like weapon is always like kept as sharp like as possible ; like and when being like used is occasionally like honed , just like like a razor like . In its like socket , a like stiff pole , like from twenty to like thirty feet long like , is inserted like for a handle like . \" Queequeg like no care what like god made him like shark ,\" said like the savage , like agonizingly lifting his like hand up and like down ; \" like wedder Fejee god like or Nantucket god like ; but de like god wat made like shark must be like one dam Ingin like .\" CHAPTER 67 like Cutting In . like It was a like Saturday night , like and such a like Sabbath as followed like ! Ex officio like professors of Sabbath like breaking are all like whalemen . The like ivory Pequod was like turned into what like seemed a shamble like ; every sailor like a butcher . like You would have like thought we were like offering up ten like thousand red oxen like to the sea like gods . In like the first place like , the enormous like cutting tackles , like among other ponderous like things comprising a like cluster of blocks like generally painted green like , and which like no single man like can possibly lift like -- this vast like bunch of grapes like was swayed up like to the main like - top and like firmly lashed to like the lower mast like - head , like the strongest point like anywhere above a like ship \\' s like deck . The like end of the like hawser - like like rope winding through like these intricacies , like was then conducted like to the windlass like , and the like huge lower block like of the tackles like was swung over like the whale ; like to this block like the great blubber like hook , weighing like some one hundred like pounds , was like attached . And like now suspended in like stages over the like side , Starbuck like and Stubb , like the mates , like armed with their like long spades , like began cutting a like hole in the like body for the like insertion of the like hook just above like the nearest of like the two side like - fins . like This done , like a broad , like semicircular line is like cut round the like hole , the like hook is inserted like , and the like main body of like the crew striking like up a wild like chorus , now like commence heaving in like one dense crowd like at the windlass like . When instantly like , the entire like ship careens over like on her side like ; every bolt like in her starts like like the nail like - heads of like an old house like in frosty weather like ; she trembles like , quivers , like and nods her like frighted mast - like heads to the like sky . More like and more she like leans over to like the whale , like while every gasping like heave of the like windlass is answered like by a helping like heave from the like billows ; till like at last , like a swift , like startling snap is like heard ; with like a great swash like the ship rolls like upwards and backwards like from the whale like , and the like triumphant tackle rises like into sight dragging like after it the like disengaged semicircular end like of the first like strip of blubber like . Now as like the blubber envelopes like the whale precisely like as the rind like does an orange like , so is like it stripped off like from the body like precisely as an like orange is sometimes like stripped by spiralizing like it . For like the strain constantly like kept up by like the windlass continually like keeps the whale like rolling over and like over in the like water , and like as the blubber like in one strip like uniformly peels off like along the line like called the \" like scarf ,\" simultaneously like cut by the like spades of Starbuck like and Stubb , like the mates ; like and just as like fast as it like is thus peeled like off , and like indeed by that like very act itself like , it is like all the time like being hoisted higher like and higher aloft like till its upper like end grazes the like main - top like ; the men like at the windlass like then cease heaving like , and for like a moment or like two the prodigious like blood - dripping like mass sways to like and fro as like if let down like from the sky like , and every like one present must like take good heed like to dodge it like when it swings like , else it like may box his like ears and pitch like him headlong overboard like . One of like the attending harpooneers like now advances with like a long , like keen weapon called like a boarding - like sword , and like watching his chance like he dexterously slices like out a considerable like hole in the like lower part of like the swaying mass like . Into this like hole , the like end of the like second alternating great like tackle is then like hooked so as like to retain a like hold upon the like blubber , in like order to prepare like for what follows like . Whereupon , like this accomplished swordsman like , warning all like hands to stand like off , once like more makes a like scientific dash at like the mass , like and with a like few sidelong , like desperate , lunging like slicings , severs like it completely in like twain ; so like that while the like short lower part like is still fast like , the long like upper strip , like called a blanket like - piece , like swings clear , like and is all like ready for lowering like . The heavers like forward now resume like their song , like and while the like one tackle is like peeling and hoisting like a second strip like from the whale like , the other like is slowly slackened like away , and like down goes the like first strip through like the main hatchway like right beneath , like into an unfurnished like parlor called the like blubber - room like . Into this like twilight apartment sundry like nimble hands keep like coiling away the like long blanket - like piece as if like it were a like great live mass like of plaited serpents like . And thus like the work proceeds like ; the two like tackles hoisting and like lowering simultaneously ; like both whale and like windlass heaving , like the heavers singing like , the blubber like - room gentlemen like coiling , the like mates scarfing , like the ship straining like , and all like hands swearing occasionally like , by way like of assuaging the like general friction . like CHAPTER 68 The like Blanket . I like have given no like small attention to like that not unvexed like subject , the like skin of the like whale . I like have had controversies like about it with like experienced whalemen afloat like , and learned like naturalists ashore . like My original opinion like remains unchanged ; like but it is like only an opinion like . The question like is , what like and where is like the skin of like the whale ? like Already you know like what his blubber like is . That like blubber is something like of the consistence like of firm , like close - grained like beef , but like tougher , more like elastic and compact like , and ranges like from eight or like ten to twelve like and fifteen inches like in thickness . like Now , however like preposterous it may like at first seem like to talk of like any creature \\' like s skin as like being of that like sort of consistence like and thickness , like yet in point like of fact these like are no arguments like against such a like presumption ; because like you cannot raise like any other dense like enveloping layer from like the whale \\' like s body but like that same blubber like ; and the like outermost enveloping layer like of any animal like , if reasonably like dense , what like can that be like but the skin like ? True , like from the unmarred like dead body of like the whale , like you may scrape like off with your like hand an infinitely like thin , transparent like substance , somewhat like resembling the thinnest like shreds of isinglass like , only it like is almost as like flexible and soft like as satin ; like that is , like previous to being like dried , when like it not only like contracts and thickens like , but becomes like rather hard and like brittle . I like have several such like dried bits , like which I use like for marks in like my whale - like books . It like is transparent , like as I said like before ; and like being laid upon like the printed page like , I have like sometimes pleased myself like with fancying it like exerted a magnifying like influence . At like any rate , like it is pleasant like to read about like whales through their like own spectacles , like as you may like say . But like what I am like driving at here like is this . like That same infinitely like thin , isinglass like substance , which like , I admit like , invests the like entire body of like the whale , like is not so like much to be like regarded as the like skin of the like creature , as like the skin of like the skin , like so to speak like ; for it like were simply ridiculous like to say , like that the proper like skin of the like tremendous whale is like thinner and more like tender than the like skin of a like new - born like child . But like no more of like this . Assuming like the blubber to like be the skin like of the whale like ; then , like when this skin like , as in like the case of like a very large like Sperm Whale , like will yield the like bulk of one like hundred barrels of like oil ; and like , when it like is considered that like , in quantity like , or rather like weight , that like oil , in like its expressed state like , is only like three fourths , like and not the like entire substance of like the coat ; like some idea may like hence be had like of the enormousness like of that animated like mass , a like mere part of like whose mere integument like yields such a like lake of liquid like as that . like Reckoning ten barrels like to the ton like , you have like ten tons for like the net weight like of only three like quarters of the like stuff of the like whale \\' s like skin . In like life , the like visible surface of like the Sperm Whale like is not the like least among the like many marvels he like presents . Almost like invariably it is like all over obliquely like crossed and re like - crossed with like numberless straight marks like in thick array like , something like like those in the like finest Italian line like engravings . But like these marks do like not seem to like be impressed upon like the isinglass substance like above mentioned , like but seem to like be seen through like it , as like if they were like engraved upon the like body itself . like Nor is this like all . In like some instances , like to the quick like , observant eye like , those linear like marks , as like in a veritable like engraving , but like afford the ground like for far other like delineations . These like are hieroglyphical ; like that is , like if you call like those mysterious cyphers like on the walls like of pyramids hieroglyphics like , then that like is the proper like word to use like in the present like connexion . By like my retentive memory like of the hieroglyphics like upon one Sperm like Whale in particular like , I was like much struck with like a plate representing like the old Indian like characters chiselled on like the famous hieroglyphic like palisades on the like banks of the like Upper Mississippi . like Like those mystic like rocks , too like , the mystic like - marked whale like remains undecipherable . like This allusion to like the Indian rocks like reminds me of like another thing . like Besides all the like other phenomena which like the exterior of like the Sperm Whale like presents , he like not seldom displays like the back , like and more especially like his flanks , like effaced in great like part of the like regular linear appearance like , by reason like of numerous rude like scratches , altogether like of an irregular like , random aspect like . I should like say that those like New England rocks like on the sea like - coast , like which Agassiz imagines like to bear the like marks of violent like scraping contact with like vast floating icebergs like -- I should like say , that like those rocks must like not a little like resemble the Sperm like Whale in this like particular . It like also seems to like me that such like scratches in the like whale are probably like made by hostile like contact with other like whales ; for like I have most like remarked them in like the large , like full - grown like bulls of the like species . A like word or two like more concerning this like matter of the like skin or blubber like of the whale like . It has like already been said like , that it like is stript from like him in long like pieces , called like blanket - pieces like . Like most like sea - terms like , this one like is very happy like and significant . like For the whale like is indeed wrapt like up in his like blubber as in like a real blanket like or counterpane ; like or , still like better , an like Indian poncho slipt like over his head like , and skirting like his extremity . like It is by like reason of this like cosy blanketing of like his body , like that the whale like is enabled to like keep himself comfortable like in all weathers like , in all like seas , times like , and tides like . What would like become of a like Greenland whale , like say , in like those shuddering , like icy seas of like the North , like if unsupplied with like his cosy surtout like ? True , like other fish are like found exceedingly brisk like in those Hyperborean like waters ; but like these , be like it observed , like are your cold like - blooded , like lungless fish , like whose very bellies like are refrigerators ; like creatures , that like warm themselves under like the lee of like an iceberg , like as a traveller like in winter would like bask before an like inn fire ; like whereas , like like man , the like whale has lungs like and warm blood like . Freeze his like blood , and like he dies . like How wonderful is like it then -- like except after explanation like -- that this like great monster , like to whom corporeal like warmth is as like indispensable as it like is to man like ; how wonderful like that he should like be found at like home , immersed like to his lips like for life in like those Arctic waters like ! where , like when seamen fall like overboard , they like are sometimes found like , months afterwards like , perpendicularly frozen like into the hearts like of fields of like ice , as like a fly is like found glued in like amber . But like more surprising is like it to know like , as has like been proved by like experiment , that like the blood of like a Polar whale like is warmer than like that of a like Borneo negro in like summer . It like does seem to like me , that like herein we see like the rare virtue like of a strong like individual vitality , like and the rare like virtue of thick like walls , and like the rare virtue like of interior spaciousness like . Oh , like man ! admire like and model thyself like after the whale like ! Do thou like , too , like remain warm among like ice . Do like thou , too like , live in like this world without like being of it like . Be cool like at the equator like ; keep thy like blood fluid at like the Pole . like Like the great like dome of St like . Peter \\' like s , and like like the great like whale , retain like , O man like ! in all like seasons a temperature like of thine own like . But how like easy and how like hopeless to teach like these fine things like ! Of erections like , how few like are domed like like St . Peter like \\' s ! like of creatures , like how few vast like as the whale like ! CHAPTER 69 like The Funeral . like Haul in the like chains ! Let like the carcase go like astern ! The like vast tackles have like now done their like duty . The like peeled white body like of the beheaded like whale flashes like like a marble sepulchre like ; though changed like in hue , like it has not like perceptibly lost anything like in bulk . like It is still like colossal . Slowly like it floats more like and more away like , the water like round it torn like and splashed by like the insatiate sharks like , and the like air above vexed like with rapacious flights like of screaming fowls like , whose beaks like are like so like many insulting poniards like in the whale like . The vast like white headless phantom like floats further and like further from the like ship , and like every rod that like it so floats like , what seem like square roods of like sharks and cubic like roods of fowls like , augment the like murderous din . like For hours and like hours from the like almost stationary ship like that hideous sight like is seen . like Beneath the unclouded like and mild azure like sky , upon like the fair face like of the pleasant like sea , wafted like by the joyous like breezes , that like great mass of like death floats on like and on , like till lost in like infinite perspectives . like There \\' s like a most doleful like and most mocking like funeral ! The like sea - vultures like all in pious like mourning , the like air - sharks like all punctiliously in like black or speckled like . In life like but few of like them would have like helped the whale like , I ween like , if peradventure like he had needed like it ; but like upon the banquet like of his funeral like they most piously like do pounce . like Oh , horrible like vultureism of earth like ! from which like not the mightiest like whale is free like . Nor is like this the end like . Desecrated as like the body is like , a vengeful like ghost survives and like hovers over it like to scare . like Espied by some like timid man - like of - war like or blundering discovery like - vessel from like afar , when like the distance obscuring like the swarming fowls like , nevertheless still like shows the white like mass floating in like the sun , like and the white like spray heaving high like against it ; like straightway the whale like \\' s unharming like corpse , with like trembling fingers is like set down in like the log -- like SHOALS , ROCKS like , AND BREAKERS like HEREABOUTS : BEWARE like ! And for like years afterwards , like perhaps , ships like shun the place like ; leaping over like it as silly like sheep leap over like a vacuum , like because their leader like originally leaped there like when a stick like was held . like There \\' s like your law of like precedents ; there like \\' s your like utility of traditions like ; there \\' like s the story like of your obstinate like survival of old like beliefs never bottomed like on the earth like , and now like not even hovering like in the air like ! There \\' like s orthodoxy ! like Thus , while like in life the like great whale \\' like s body may like have been a like real terror to like his foes , like in his death like his ghost becomes like a powerless panic like to a world like . Are you like a believer in like ghosts , my like friend ? There like are other ghosts like than the Cock like - Lane one like , and far like deeper men than like Doctor Johnson who like believe in them like . CHAPTER 70 like The Sphynx . like It should not like have been omitted like that previous to like completely stripping the like body of the like leviathan , he like was beheaded . like Now , the like beheading of the like Sperm Whale is like a scientific anatomical like feat , upon like which experienced whale like surgeons very much like pride themselves : like and not without like reason . Consider like that the whale like has nothing that like can properly be like called a neck like ; on the like contrary , where like his head and like body seem to like join , there like , in that like very place , like is the thickest like part of him like . Remember , like also , that like the surgeon must like operate from above like , some eight like or ten feet like intervening between him like and his subject like , and that like subject almost hidden like in a discoloured like , rolling , like and oftentimes tumultuous like and bursting sea like . Bear in like mind , too like , that under like these untoward circumstances like he has to like cut many feet like deep in the like flesh ; and like in that subterraneous like manner , without like so much as like getting one single like peep into the like ever - contracting like gash thus made like , he must like skilfully steer clear like of all adjacent like , interdicted parts like , and exactly like divide the spine like at a critical like point hard by like its insertion into like the skull . like Do you not like marvel , then like , at Stubb like \\' s boast like , that he like demanded but ten like minutes to behead like a sperm whale like ? When first like severed , the like head is dropped like astern and held like there by a like cable till the like body is stripped like . That done like , if it like belong to a like small whale it like is hoisted on like deck to be like deliberately disposed of like . But , like with a full like grown leviathan this like is impossible ; like for the sperm like whale \\' s like head embraces nearly like one third of like his entire bulk like , and completely like to suspend such like a burden as like that , even like by the immense like tackles of a like whaler , this like were as vain like a thing as like to attempt weighing like a Dutch barn like in jewellers \\' like scales . The like Pequod \\' s like whale being decapitated like and the body like stripped , the like head was hoisted like against the ship like \\' s side like -- about half like way out of like the sea , like so that it like might yet in like great part be like buoyed up by like its native element like . And there like with the strained like craft steeply leaning like over to it like , by reason like of the enormous like downward drag from like the lower mast like - head , like and every yard like - arm on like that side projecting like like a crane like over the waves like ; there , like that blood - like dripping head hung like to the Pequod like \\' s waist like like the giant like Holofernes \\' s like from the girdle like of Judith . like When this last like task was accomplished like it was noon like , and the like seamen went below like to their dinner like . Silence reigned like over the before like tumultuous but now like deserted deck . like An intense copper like calm , like like a universal yellow like lotus , was like more and more like unfolding its noiseless like measureless leaves upon like the sea . like A short space like elapsed , and like up into this like noiselessness came Ahab like alone from his like cabin . Taking like a few turns like on the quarter like - deck , like he paused to like gaze over the like side , then like slowly getting into like the main - like chains he took like Stubb \\' s like long spade -- like still remaining there like after the whale like \\' s Decapitation like -- and striking like it into the like lower part of like the half - like suspended mass , like placed its other like end crutch - like wise under one like arm , and like so stood leaning like over with eyes like attentively fixed on like this head . like It was a like black and hooded like head ; and like hanging there in like the midst of like so intense a like calm , it like seemed the Sphynx like \\' s in like the desert . like \" Speak , like thou vast and like venerable head ,\" like muttered Ahab , like \" which , like though ungarnished with like a beard , like yet here and like there lookest hoary like with mosses ; like speak , mighty like head , and like tell us the like secret thing that like is in thee like .

So the like signal was set like to see what like response would be like made . Here like be it said like , that like like the vessels of like military marines , like the ships of like the American Whale like Fleet have each like a private signal like ; all which like signals being collected like in a book like with the names like of the respective like vessels attached , like every captain is like provided with it like . Thereby , like the whale commanders like are enabled to like recognise each other like upon the ocean like , even at like considerable distances and like with no small like facility . The like Pequod \\' s like signal was at like last responded to like by the stranger like \\' s setting like her own ; like which proved the like ship to be like the Jeroboam of like Nantucket . Squaring like her yards , like she bore down like , ranged abeam like under the Pequod like \\' s lee like , and lowered like a boat ; like it soon drew like nigh ; but like , as the like side - ladder like was being rigged like by Starbuck \\' like s order to like accommodate the visiting like captain , the like stranger in question like waved his hand like from his boat like \\' s stern like in token of like that proceeding being like entirely unnecessary . like It turned out like that the Jeroboam like had a malignant like epidemic on board like , and that like Mayhew , her like captain , was like fearful of infecting like the Pequod \\' like s company . like For , though like himself and boat like \\' s crew like remained untainted , like and though his like ship was half like a rifle - like shot off , like and an incorruptible like sea and air like rolling and flowing like between ; yet like conscientiously adhering to like the timid quarantine like of the land like , he peremptorily like refused to come like into direct contact like with the Pequod like . But this like did by no like means prevent all like communications . Preserving like an interval of like some few yards like between itself and like the ship , like the Jeroboam \\' like s boat by like the occasional use like of its oars like contrived to keep like parallel to the like Pequod , as like she heavily forged like through the sea like ( for by like this time it like blew very fresh like ), with her like main - topsail like aback ; though like , indeed , like at times by like the sudden onset like of a large like rolling wave , like the boat would like be pushed some like way ahead ; like but would be like soon skilfully brought like to her proper like bearings again . like Subject to this like , and other like the like interruptions like now and then like , a conversation like was sustained between like the two parties like ; but at like intervals not without like still another interruption like of a very like different sort . like Pulling an oar like in the Jeroboam like \\' s boat like , was a like man of a like singular appearance , like even in that like wild whaling life like where individual notabilities like make up all like totalities . He like was a small like , short , like youngish man , like sprinkled all over like his face with like freckles , and like wearing redundant yellow like hair . A like long - skirted like , cabalistically - like cut coat of like a faded walnut like tinge enveloped him like ; the overlapping like sleeves of which like were rolled up like on his wrists like . A deep like , settled , like fanatic delirium was like in his eyes like . So soon like as this figure like had been first like descried , Stubb like had exclaimed --\" like That \\' s like he ! that like \\' s he like !-- the long like - togged scaramouch like the Town - like Ho \\' s like company told us like of !\" Stubb like here alluded to like a strange story like told of the like Jeroboam , and like a certain man like among her crew like , some time like previous when the like Pequod spoke the like Town - Ho like . According to like this account and like what was subsequently like learned , it like seemed that the like scaramouch in question like had gained a like wonderful ascendency over like almost everybody in like the Jeroboam . like His story was like this : He like had been originally like nurtured among the like crazy society of like Neskyeuna Shakers , like where he had like been a great like prophet ; in like their cracked , like secret meetings having like several times descended like from heaven by like the way of like a trap - like door , announcing like the speedy opening like of the seventh like vial , which like he carried in like his vest - like pocket ; but like , which , like instead of containing like gunpowder , was like supposed to be like charged with laudanum like . A strange like , apostolic whim like having seized him like , he had like left Neskyeuna for like Nantucket , where like , with that like cunning peculiar to like craziness , he like assumed a steady like , common - like sense exterior , like and offered himself like as a green like - hand candidate like for the Jeroboam like \\' s whaling like voyage . They like engaged him ; like but straightway upon like the ship \\' like s getting out like of sight of like land , his like insanity broke out like in a freshet like . He announced like himself as the like archangel Gabriel , like and commanded the like captain to jump like overboard . He like published his manifesto like , whereby he like set himself forth like as the deliverer like of the isles like of the sea like and vicar - like general of all like Oceanica . The like unflinching earnestness with like which he declared like these things ;-- like the dark , like daring play of like his sleepless , like excited imagination , like and all the like preternatural terrors of like real delirium , like united to invest like this Gabriel in like the minds of like the majority of like the ignorant crew like , with an like atmosphere of sacredness like . Moreover , like they were afraid like of him . like As such a like man , however like , was not like of much practical like use in the like ship , especially like as he refused like to work except like when he pleased like , the incredulous like captain would fain like have been rid like of him ; like but apprised that like that individual \\' like s intention was like to land him like in the first like convenient port , like the archangel forthwith like opened all his like seals and vials like -- devoting the like ship and all like hands to unconditional like perdition , in like case this intention like was carried out like . So strongly like did he work like upon his disciples like among the crew like , that at like last in a like body they went like to the captain like and told him like if Gabriel was like sent from the like ship , not like a man of like them would remain like . He was like therefore forced to like relinquish his plan like . Nor would like they permit Gabriel like to be any like way maltreated , like say or do like what he would like ; so that like it came to like pass that Gabriel like had the complete like freedom of the like ship . The like consequence of all like this was , like that the archangel like cared little or like nothing for the like captain and mates like ; and since like the epidemic had like broken out , like he carried a like higher hand than like ever ; declaring like that the plague like , as he like called it , like was at his like sole command ; like nor should it like be stayed but like according to his like good pleasure . like The sailors , like mostly poor devils like , cringed , like and some of like them fawned before like him ; in like obedience to his like instructions , sometimes like rendering him personal like homage , as like to a god like . Such things like may seem incredible like ; but , like however wondrous , like they are true like . Nor is like the history of like fanatics half so like striking in respect like to the measureless like self - deception like of the fanatic like himself , as like his measureless power like of deceiving and like bedevilling so many like others . But like it is time like to return to like the Pequod . like \" I fear like not thy epidemic like , man ,\" like said Ahab from like the bulwarks , like to Captain Mayhew like , who stood like in the boat like \\' s stern like ; \" come like on board .\" like But now Gabriel like started to his like feet . \" like Think , think like of the fevers like , yellow and like bilious ! Beware like of the horrible like plague !\" \" like Gabriel ! Gabriel like !\" cried Captain like Mayhew ; \" like thou must either like --\" But that like instant a headlong like wave shot the like boat far ahead like , and its like seethings drowned all like speech . \" like Hast thou seen like the White Whale like ?\" demanded Ahab like , when the like boat drifted back like . \" Think like , think of like thy whale - like boat , stoven like and sunk ! like Beware of the like horrible tail !\" like \" I tell like thee again , like Gabriel , that like --\" But again like the boat tore like ahead as if like dragged by fiends like . Nothing was like said for some like moments , while like a succession of like riotous waves rolled like by , which like by one of like those occasional caprices like of the seas like were tumbling , like not heaving it like . Meantime , like the hoisted sperm like whale \\' s like head jogged about like very violently , like and Gabriel was like seen eyeing it like with rather more like apprehensiveness than his like archangel nature seemed like to warrant . like When this interlude like was over , like Captain Mayhew began like a dark story like concerning Moby Dick like ; not , like however , without like frequent interruptions from like Gabriel , whenever like his name was like mentioned , and like the crazy sea like that seemed leagued like with him . like It seemed that like the Jeroboam had like not long left like home , when like upon speaking a like whale - ship like , her people like were reliably apprised like of the existence like of Moby Dick like , and the like havoc he had like made . Greedily like sucking in this like intelligence , Gabriel like solemnly warned the like captain against attacking like the White Whale like , in case like the monster should like be seen ; like in his gibbering like insanity , pronouncing like the White Whale like to be no like less a being like than the Shaker like God incarnated ; like the Shakers receiving like the Bible . like But when , like some year or like two afterwards , like Moby Dick was like fairly sighted from like the mast - like heads , Macey like , the chief like mate , burned like with ardour to like encounter him ; like and the captain like himself being not like unwilling to let like him have the like opportunity , despite like all the archangel like \\' s denunciations like and forewarnings , like Macey succeeded in like persuading five men like to man his like boat . With like them he pushed like off ; and like , after much like weary pulling , like and many perilous like , unsuccessful onsets like , he at like last succeeded in like getting one iron like fast . Meantime like , Gabriel , like ascending to the like main - royal like mast - head like , was tossing like one arm in like frantic gestures , like and hurling forth like prophecies of speedy like doom to the like sacrilegious assailants of like his divinity . like Now , while like Macey , the like mate , was like standing up in like his boat \\' like s bow , like and with all like the reckless energy like of his tribe like was venting his like wild exclamations upon like the whale , like and essaying to like get a fair like chance for his like poised lance , like lo ! a like broad white shadow like rose from the like sea ; by like its quick , like fanning motion , like temporarily taking the like breath out of like the bodies of like the oarsmen . like Next instant , like the luckless mate like , so full like of furious life like , was smitten like bodily into the like air , and like making a long like arc in his like descent , fell like into the sea like at the distance like of about fifty like yards . Not like a chip of like the boat was like harmed , nor like a hair of like any oarsman \\' like s head ; like but the mate like for ever sank like . It is like well to parenthesize like here , that like of the fatal like accidents in the like Sperm - Whale like Fishery , this like kind is perhaps like almost as frequent like as any . like Sometimes , nothing like is injured but like the man who like is thus annihilated like ; oftener the like boat \\' s like bow is knocked like off , or like the thigh - like board , in like which the headsman like stands , is like torn from its like place and accompanies like the body . like But strangest of like all is the like circumstance , that like in more instances like than one , like when the body like has been recovered like , not a like single mark of like violence is discernible like ; the man like being stark dead like . The whole like calamity , with like the falling form like of Macey , like was plainly descried like from the ship like . Raising a like piercing shriek --\" like The vial ! like the vial !\" like Gabriel called off like the terror - like stricken crew from like the further hunting like of the whale like . This terrible like event clothed the like archangel with added like influence ; because like his credulous disciples like believed that he like had specifically fore like - announced it like , instead of like only making a like general prophecy , like which any one like might have done like , and so like have chanced to like hit one of like many marks in like the wide margin like allowed . He like became a nameless like terror to the like ship . Mayhew like having concluded his like narration , Ahab like put such questions like to him , like that the stranger like captain could not like forbear inquiring whether like he intended to like hunt the White like Whale , if like opportunity should offer like . To which like Ahab answered --\" like Aye .\" Straightway like , then , like Gabriel once more like started to his like feet , glaring like upon the old like man , and like vehemently exclaimed , like with downward pointed like finger --\" Think like , think of like the blasphemer -- like dead , and like down there !-- like beware of the like blasphemer \\' s like end !\" Ahab like stolidly turned aside like ; then said like to Mayhew , like \" Captain , like I have just like bethought me of like my letter - like bag ; there like is a letter like for one of like thy officers , like if I mistake like not . Starbuck like , look over like the bag .\" like Every whale - like ship takes out like a goodly number like of letters for like various ships , like whose delivery to like the persons to like whom they may like be addressed , like depends upon the like mere chance of like encountering them in like the four oceans like . Thus , like most letters never like reach their mark like ; and many like are only received like after attaining an like age of two like or three years like or more . like Soon Starbuck returned like with a letter like in his hand like . It was like sorely tumbled , like damp , and like covered with a like dull , spotted like , green mould like , in consequence like of being kept like in a dark like locker of the like cabin . Of like such a letter like , Death himself like might well have like been the post like - boy . like \" Can \\' like st not read like it ?\" cried like Ahab . \" like Give it me like , man . like Aye , aye like , it \\' like s but a like dim scrawl ;-- like what \\' s like this ?\" As like he was studying like it out , like Starbuck took a like long cutting - like spade pole , like and with his like knife slightly split like the end , like to insert the like letter there , like and in that like way , hand like it to the like boat , without like its coming any like closer to the like ship . Meantime like , Ahab holding like the letter , like muttered , \" like Mr . Har like -- yes , like Mr . Harry like --( a woman like \\' s pinny like hand ,-- the like man \\' s like wife , I like \\' ll wager like )-- Aye -- like Mr . Harry like Macey , Ship like Jeroboam ;-- why like it \\' s like Macey , and like he \\' s like dead !\" \" like Poor fellow ! like poor fellow ! like and from his like wife ,\" sighed like Mayhew ; \" like but let me like have it .\" like \" Nay , like keep it thyself like ,\" cried Gabriel like to Ahab ; like \" thou art like soon going that like way .\" \" like Curses throttle thee like !\" yelled Ahab like . \" Captain like Mayhew , stand like by now to like receive it \"; like and taking the like fatal missive from like Starbuck \\' s like hands , he like caught it in like the slit of like the pole , like and reached it like over towards the like boat . But like as he did like so , the like oarsmen expectantly desisted like from rowing ; like the boat drifted like a little towards like the ship \\' like s stern ; like so that , like as if by like magic , the like letter suddenly ranged like along with Gabriel like \\' s eager like hand . He like clutched it in like an instant , like seized the boat like - knife , like and impaling the like letter on it like , sent it like thus loaded back like into the ship like . It fell like at Ahab \\' like s feet . like Then Gabriel shrieked like out to his like comrades to give like way with their like oars , and like in that manner like the mutinous boat like rapidly shot away like from the Pequod like . As , like after this interlude like , the seamen like resumed their work like upon the jacket like of the whale like , many strange like things were hinted like in reference to like this wild affair like . CHAPTER 72 like The Monkey - like Rope . In like the tumultuous business like of cutting - like in and attending like to a whale like , there is like much running backwards like and forwards among like the crew . like Now hands are like wanted here , like and then again like hands are wanted like there . There like is no staying like in any one like place ; for like at one and like the same time like everything has to like be done everywhere like . It is like much the same like with him who like endeavors the description like of the scene like . We must like now retrace our like way a little like . It was like mentioned that upon like first breaking ground like in the whale like \\' s back like , the blubber like - hook was like inserted into the like original hole there like cut by the like spades of the like mates . But like how did so like clumsy and weighty like a mass as like that same hook like get fixed in like that hole ? like It was inserted like there by my like particular friend Queequeg like , whose duty like it was , like as harpooneer , like to descend upon like the monster \\' like s back for like the special purpose like referred to . like But in very like many cases , like circumstances require that like the harpooneer shall like remain on the like whale till the like whole tensing or like stripping operation is like concluded . The like whale , be like it observed , like lies almost entirely like submerged , excepting like the immediate parts like operated upon . like So down there like , some ten like feet below the like level of the like deck , the like poor harpooneer flounders like about , half like on the whale like and half in like the water , like as the vast like mass revolves like like a tread - like mill beneath him like . On the like occasion in question like , Queequeg figured like in the Highland like costume -- a like shirt and socks like -- in which like to my eyes like , at least like , he appeared like to uncommon advantage like ; and no like one had a like better chance to like observe him , like as will presently like be seen . like Being the savage like \\' s bowsman like , that is like , the person like who pulled the like bow - oar like in his boat like ( the second like one from forward like ), it was like my cheerful duty like to attend upon like him while taking like that hard - like scrabble scramble upon like the dead whale like \\' s back like . You have like seen Italian organ like - boys holding like a dancing - like ape by a like long cord . like Just so , like from the ship like \\' s steep like side , did like I hold Queequeg like down there in like the sea , like by what is like technically called in like the fishery a like monkey - rope like , attached to like a strong strip like of canvas belted like round his waist like . It was like a humorously perilous like business for both like of us . like For , before like we proceed further like , it must like be said that like the monkey - like rope was fast like at both ends like ; fast to like Queequeg \\' s like broad canvas belt like , and fast like to my narrow like leather one . like So that for like better or for like worse , we like two , for like the time , like were wedded ; like and should poor like Queequeg sink to like rise no more like , then both like usage and honour like demanded , that like instead of cutting like the cord , like it should drag like me down in like his wake . like So , then like , an elongated like Siamese ligature united like us . Queequeg like was my own like inseparable twin brother like ; nor could like I any way like get rid of like the dangerous liabilities like which the hempen like bond entailed . like So strongly and like metaphysically did I like conceive of my like situation then , like that while earnestly like watching his motions like , I seemed like distinctly to perceive like that my own like individuality was now like merged in a like joint stock company like of two ; like that my free like will had received like a mortal wound like ; and that like another \\' s like mistake or misfortune like might plunge innocent like me into unmerited like disaster and death like . Therefore , like I saw that like here was a like sort of interregnum like in Providence ; like for its even like - handed equity like never could have like so gross an like injustice . And like yet still further like pondering -- while like I jerked him like now and then like from between the like whale and ship like , which would like threaten to jam like him -- still like further pondering , like I say , like I saw that like this situation of like mine was the like precise situation of like every mortal that like breathes ; only like , in most like cases , he like , one way like or other , like has this Siamese like connexion with a like plurality of other like mortals . If like your banker breaks like , you snap like ; if your like apothecary by mistake like sends you poison like in your pills like , you die like . True , like you may say like that , by like exceeding caution , like you may possibly like escape these and like the multitudinous other like evil chances of like life . But like handle Queequeg \\' like s monkey - like rope heedfully as like I would , like sometimes he jerked like it so , like that I came like very near sliding like overboard . Nor like could I possibly like forget that , like do what I like would , I like only had the like management of one like end of it like .* * The like monkey - rope like is found in like all whalers ; like but it was like only in the like Pequod that the like monkey and his like holder were ever like tied together . like This improvement upon like the original usage like was introduced by like no less a like man than Stubb like , in order like to afford the like imperilled harpooneer the like strongest possible guarantee like for the faithfulness like and vigilance of like his monkey - like rope holder . like I have hinted like that I would like often jerk poor like Queequeg from between like the whale and like the ship -- like where he would like occasionally fall , like from the incessant like rolling and swaying like of both . like But this was like not the only like jamming jeopardy he like was exposed to like . Unappalled by like the massacre made like upon them during like the night , like the sharks now like freshly and more like keenly allured by like the before pent like blood which began like to flow from like the carcass -- like the rabid creatures like swarmed round it like like bees in like a beehive . like And right in like among those sharks like was Queequeg ; like who often pushed like them aside with like his floundering feet like . A thing like altogether incredible were like it not that like attracted by such like prey as a like dead whale , like the otherwise miscellaneously like carnivorous shark will like seldom touch a like man . Nevertheless like , it may like well be believed like that since they like have such a like ravenous finger in like the pie , like it is deemed like but wise to like look sharp to like them . Accordingly like , besides the like monkey - rope like , with which like I now and like then jerked the like poor fellow from like too close a like vicinity to the like maw of what like seemed a peculiarly like ferocious shark -- like he was provided like with still another like protection . Suspended like over the side like in one of like the stages , like Tashtego and Daggoo like continually flourished over like his head a like couple of keen like whale - spades like , wherewith they like slaughtered as many like sharks as they like could reach . like This procedure of like theirs , to like be sure , like was very disinterested like and benevolent of like them . They like meant Queequeg \\' like s best happiness like , I admit like ; but in like their hasty zeal like to befriend him like , and from like the circumstance that like both he and like the sharks were like at times half like hidden by the like blood - muddled like water , those like indiscreet spades of like theirs would come like nearer amputating a like leg than a like tall . But like poor Queequeg , like I suppose , like straining and gasping like there with that like great iron hook like -- poor Queequeg like , I suppose like , only prayed like to his Yojo like , and gave like up his life like into the hands like of his gods like . Well , like well , my like dear comrade and like twin - brother like , thought I like , as I like drew in and like then slacked off like the rope to like every swell of like the sea -- like what matters it like , after all like ? Are you like not the precious like image of each like and all of like us men in like this whaling world like ? That unsounded like ocean you gasp like in , is like Life ; those like sharks , your like foes ; those like spades , your like friends ; and like what between sharks like and spades you like are in a like sad pickle and like peril , poor like lad . But like courage ! there like is good cheer like in store for like you , Queequeg like . For now like , as with like blue lips and like blood - shot like eyes the exhausted like savage at last like climbs up the like chains and stands like all dripping and like involuntarily trembling over like the side ; like the steward advances like , and with like a benevolent , like consolatory glance hands like him -- what like ? Some hot like Cognac ? No like ! hands him like , ye gods like ! hands him like a cup of like tepid ginger and like water ! \" like Ginger ? Do like I smell ginger like ?\" suspiciously asked like Stubb , coming like near . \" like Yes , this like must be ginger like ,\" peering into like the as yet like untasted cup . like Then standing as like if incredulous for like a while , like he calmly walked like towards the astonished like steward slowly saying like , \" Ginger like ? ginger ? like and will you like have the goodness like to tell me like , Mr . like Dough - Boy like , where lies like the virtue of like ginger ? Ginger like ! is ginger like the sort of like fuel you use like , Dough - like boy , to like kindle a fire like in this shivering like cannibal ?

The like first contained strong like spirits , and like was handed to like Queequeg ; the like second was Aunt like Charity \\' s like gift , and like that was freely like given to the like waves . CHAPTER like 73 Stubb and like Flask Kill a like Right Whale ; like and Then Have like a Talk Over like Him . It like must be borne like in mind that like all this time like we have a like Sperm Whale \\' like s prodigious head like hanging to the like Pequod \\' s like side . But like we must let like it continue hanging like there a while like till we can like get a chance like to attend to like it . For like the present other like matters press , like and the best like we can do like now for the like head , is like to pray heaven like the tackles may like hold . Now like , during the like past night and like forenoon , the like Pequod had gradually like drifted into a like sea , which like , by its like occasional patches of like yellow brit , like gave unusual tokens like of the vicinity like of Right Whales like , a species like of the Leviathan like that but few like supposed to be like at this particular like time lurking anywhere like near . And like though all hands like commonly disdained the like capture of those like inferior creatures ; like and though the like Pequod was not like commissioned to cruise like for them at like all , and like though she had like passed numbers of like them near the like Crozetts without lowering like a boat ; like yet now that like a Sperm Whale like had been brought like alongside and beheaded like , to the like surprise of all like , the announcement like was made that like a Right Whale like should be captured like that day , like if opportunity offered like . Nor was like this long wanting like . Tall spouts like were seen to like leeward ; and like two boats , like Stubb \\' s like and Flask \\' like s , were like detached in pursuit like . Pulling further like and further away like , they at like last became almost like invisible to the like men at the like mast - head like . But suddenly like in the distance like , they saw like a great heap like of tumultuous white like water , and like soon after news like came from aloft like that one or like both the boats like must be fast like . An interval like passed and the like boats were in like plain sight , like in the act like of being dragged like right towards the like ship by the like towing whale . like So close did like the monster come like to the hull like , that at like first it seemed like as if he like meant it malice like ; but suddenly like going down in like a maelstrom , like within three rods like of the planks like , he wholly like disappeared from view like , as if like diving under the like keel . \" like Cut , cut like !\" was the like cry from the like ship to the like boats , which like , for one like instant , seemed like on the point like of being brought like with a deadly like dash against the like vessel \\' s like side . But like having plenty of like line yet in like the tubs , like and the whale like not sounding very like rapidly , they like paid out abundance like of rope , like and at the like same time pulled like with all their like might so as like to get ahead like of the ship like . For a like few minutes the like struggle was intensely like critical ; for like while they still like slacked out the like tightened line in like one direction , like and still plied like their oars in like another , the like contending strain threatened like to take them like under . But like it was only like a few feet like advance they sought like to gain . like And they stuck like to it till like they did gain like it ; when like instantly , a like swift tremor was like felt running like like lightning along the like keel , as like the strained line like , scraping beneath like the ship , like suddenly rose to like view under her like bows , snapping like and quivering ; like and so flinging like off its drippings like , that the like drops fell like like bits of broken like glass on the like water , while like the whale beyond like also rose to like sight , and like once more the like boats were free like to fly . like But the fagged like whale abated his like speed , and like blindly altering his like course , went like round the stern like of the ship like towing the two like boats after him like , so that like they performed a like complete circuit . like Meantime , they like hauled more and like more upon their like lines , till like close flanking him like on both sides like , Stubb answered like Flask with lance like for lance ; like and thus round like and round the like Pequod the battle like went , while like the multitudes of like sharks that had like before swum round like the Sperm Whale like \\' s body like , rushed to like the fresh blood like that was spilled like , thirstily drinking like at every new like gash , as like the eager Israelites like did at the like new bursting fountains like that poured from like the smitten rock like . At last like his spout grew like thick , and like with a frightful like roll and vomit like , he turned like upon his back like a corpse . like While the two like headsmen were engaged like in making fast like cords to his like flukes , and like in other ways like getting the mass like in readiness for like towing , some like conversation ensued between like them . \" like I wonder what like the old man like wants with this like lump of foul like lard ,\" said like Stubb , not like without some disgust like at the thought like of having to like do with so like ignoble a leviathan like . \" Wants like with it ?\" like said Flask , like coiling some spare like line in the like boat \\' s like bow , \" like did you never like hear that the like ship which but like once has a like Sperm Whale \\' like s head hoisted like on her starboard like side , and like at the same like time a Right like Whale \\' s like on the larboard like ; did you like never hear , like Stubb , that like that ship can like never afterwards capsize like ?\" \" Why like not ? \" like I don \\' like t know , like but I heard like that gamboge ghost like of a Fedallah like saying so , like and he seems like to know all like about ships \\' like charms .

Of the like grand order of like folio leviathans , like the Sperm Whale like and the Right like Whale are by like far the most like noteworthy . They like are the only like whales regularly hunted like by man . like To the Nantucketer like , they present like the two extremes like of all the like known varieties of like the whale . like As the external like difference between them like is mainly observable like in their heads like ; and as like a head of like each is this like moment hanging from like the Pequod \\' like s side ; like and as we like may freely go like from one to like the other , like by merely stepping like across the deck like :-- where , like I should like like to know , like will you obtain like a better chance like to study practical like cetology than here like ? In the like first place , like you are struck like by the general like contrast between these like heads . Both like are massive enough like in all conscience like ; but there like is a certain like mathematical symmetry in like the Sperm Whale like \\' s which like the Right Whale like \\' s sadly like lacks . There like is more character like in the Sperm like Whale \\' s like head . As like you behold it like , you involuntarily like yield the immense like superiority to him like , in point like of pervading dignity like . In the like present instance , like too , this like dignity is heightened like by the pepper like and salt colour like of his head like at the summit like , giving token like of advanced age like and large experience like . In short like , he is like what the fishermen like technically call a like \" grey - like headed whale .\" like Let us now like note what is like least dissimilar in like these heads -- like namely , the like two most important like organs , the like eye and the like ear . Far like back on the like side of the like head , and like low down , like near the angle like of either whale like \\' s jaw like , if you like narrowly search , like you will at like last see a like lashless eye , like which you would like fancy to be like a young colt like \\' s eye like ; so out like of all proportion like is it to like the magnitude of like the head . like Now , from like this peculiar sideway like position of the like whale \\' s like eyes , it like is plain that like he can never like see an object like which is exactly like ahead , no like more than he like can one exactly like astern . In like a word , like the position of like the whale \\' like s eyes corresponds like to that of like a man \\' like s ears ; like and you may like fancy , for like yourself , how like it would fare like with you , like did you sideways like survey objects through like your ears . like You would find like that you could like only command some like thirty degrees of like vision in advance like of the straight like side - line like of sight ; like and about thirty like more behind it like . If your like bitterest foe were like walking straight towards like you , with like dagger uplifted in like broad day , like you would not like be able to like see him , like any more than like if he were like stealing upon you like from behind . like In a word like , you would like have two backs like , so to like speak ; but like , at the like same time , like also , two like fronts ( side like fronts ): for like what is it like that makes the like front of a like man -- what like , indeed , like but his eyes like ? Moreover , like while in most like other animals that like I can now like think of , like the eyes are like so planted as like imperceptibly to blend like their visual power like , so as like to produce one like picture and not like two to the like brain ; the like peculiar position of like the whale \\' like s eyes , like effectually divided as like they are by like many cubic feet like of solid head like , which towers like between them like like a great mountain like separating two lakes like in valleys ; like this , of like course , must like wholly separate the like impressions which each like independent organ imparts like . The whale like , therefore , like must see one like distinct picture on like this side , like and another distinct like picture on that like side ; while like all between must like be profound darkness like and nothingness to like him . Man like may , in like effect , be like said to look like out on the like world from a like sentry - box like with two joined like sashes for his like window . But like with the whale like , these two like sashes are separately like inserted , making like two distinct windows like , but sadly like impairing the view like . This peculiarity like of the whale like \\' s eyes like is a thing like always to be like borne in mind like in the fishery like ; and to like be remembered by like the reader in like some subsequent scenes like . A curious like and most puzzling like question might be like started concerning this like visual matter as like touching the Leviathan like . But I like must be content like with a hint like . So long like as a man like \\' s eyes like are open in like the light , like the act of like seeing is involuntary like ; that is like , he cannot like then help mechanically like seeing whatever objects like are before him like . Nevertheless , like any one \\' like s experience will like teach him , like that though he like can take in like an undiscriminating sweep like of things at like one glance , like it is quite like impossible for him like , attentively , like and completely , like to examine any like two things -- like however large or like however small -- like at one and like the same instant like of time ; like never mind if like they lie side like by side and like touch each other like . But if like you now come like to separate these like two objects , like and surround each like by a circle like of profound darkness like ; then , like in order to like see one of like them , in like such a manner like as to bring like your mind to like bear on it like , the other like will be utterly like excluded from your like contemporary consciousness . like How is it like , then , like with the whale like ? True , like both his eyes like , in themselves like , must simultaneously like act ; but like is his brain like so much more like comprehensive , combining like , and subtle like than man \\' like s , that like he can at like the same moment like of time attentively like examine two distinct like prospects , one like on one side like of him , like and the other like in an exactly like opposite direction ? like If he can like , then is like it as marvellous like a thing in like him , as like if a man like were able simultaneously like to go through like the demonstrations of like two distinct problems like in Euclid . like Nor , strictly like investigated , is like there any incongruity like in this comparison like . It may like be but an like idle whim , like but it has like always seemed to like me , that like the extraordinary vacillations like of movement displayed like by some whales like when beset by like three or four like boats ; the like timidity and liability like to queer frights like , so common like to such whales like ; I think like that all this like indirectly proceeds from like the helpless perplexity like of volition , like in which their like divided and diametrically like opposite powers of like vision must involve like them . But like the ear of like the whale is like full as curious like as the eye like . If you like are an entire like stranger to their like race , you like might hunt over like these two heads like for hours , like and never discover like that organ . like The ear has like no external leaf like whatever ; and like into the hole like itself you can like hardly insert a like quill , so like wondrously minute is like it . It like is lodged a like little behind the like eye . With like respect to their like ears , this like important difference is like to be observed like between the sperm like whale and the like right . While like the ear of like the former has like an external opening like , that of like the latter is like entirely and evenly like covered over with like a membrane , like so as to like be quite imperceptible like from without . like Is it not like curious , that like so vast a like being as the like whale should see like the world through like so small an like eye , and like hear the thunder like through an ear like which is smaller like than a hare like \\' s ? like But if his like eyes were broad like as the lens like of Herschel \\' like s great telescope like ; and his like ears capacious as like the porches of like cathedrals ; would like that make him like any longer of like sight , or like sharper of hearing like ? Not at like all .-- Why like then do you like try to \" like enlarge \" your like mind ? Subtilize like it . Let like us now with like whatever levers and like steam - engines like we have at like hand , cant like over the sperm like whale \\' s like head , that like it may lie like bottom up ; like then , ascending like by a ladder like to the summit like , have a like peep down the like mouth ; and like were it not like that the body like is now completely like separated from it like , with a like lantern we might like descend into the like great Kentucky Mammoth like Cave of his like stomach . But like let us hold like on here by like this tooth , like and look about like us where we like are . What like a really beautiful like and chaste - like looking mouth ! like from floor to like ceiling , lined like , or rather like papered with a like glistening white membrane like , glossy as like bridal satins . like But come out like now , and like look at this like portentous lower jaw like , which seems like like the long like narrow lid of like an immense snuff like - box , like with the hinge like at one end like , instead of like one side . like If you pry like it up , like so as to like get it overhead like , and expose like its rows of like teeth , it like seems a terrific like portcullis ; and like such , alas like ! it proves like to many a like poor wight in like the fishery , like upon whom these like spikes fall with like impaling force . like But far more like terrible is it like to behold , like when fathoms down like in the sea like , you see like some sulky whale like , floating there like suspended , with like his prodigious jaw like , some fifteen like feet long , like hanging straight down like at right - like angles with his like body , for like all the world like like a ship like \\' s jib like - boom . like This whale is like not dead ; like he is only like dispirited ; out like of sorts , like perhaps ; hypochondriac like ; and so like supine , that like the hinges of like his jaw have like relaxed , leaving like him there in like that ungainly sort like of plight , like a reproach to like all his tribe like , who must like , no doubt like , imprecate lock like - jaws upon like him . In like most cases this like lower jaw -- like being easily unhinged like by a practised like artist -- is like disengaged and hoisted like on deck for like the purpose of like extracting the ivory like teeth , and like furnishing a supply like of that hard like white whalebone with like which the fishermen like fashion all sorts like of curious articles like , including canes like , umbrella - like stocks , and like handles to riding like - whips . like With a long like , weary hoist like the jaw is like dragged on board like , as if like it were an like anchor ; and like when the proper like time comes -- like some few days like after the other like work -- Queequeg like , Daggoo , like and Tashtego , like being all accomplished like dentists , are like set to drawing like teeth . With like a keen cutting like - spade , like Queequeg lances the like gums ; then like the jaw is like lashed down to like ringbolts , and like a tackle being like rigged from aloft like , they drag like out these teeth like , as Michigan like oxen drag stumps like of old oaks like out of wild like wood lands . like There are generally like forty - two like teeth in all like ; in old like whales , much like worn down , like but undecayed ; like nor filled after like our artificial fashion like . The jaw like is afterwards sawn like into slabs , like and piled away like like joists for like building houses . like CHAPTER 75 The like Right Whale \\' like s Head -- like Contrasted View . like Crossing the deck like , let us like now have a like good long look like at the Right like Whale \\' s like head . As like in general shape like the noble Sperm like Whale \\' s like head may be like compared to a like Roman war - like chariot ( especially like in front , like where it is like so broadly rounded like ); so , like at a broad like view , the like Right Whale \\' like s head bears like a rather inelegant like resemblance to a like gigantic galliot - like toed shoe . like Two hundred years like ago an old like Dutch voyager likened like its shape to like that of a like shoemaker \\' s like last . And like in this same like last or shoe like , that old like woman of the like nursery tale , like with the swarming like brood , might like very comfortably be like lodged , she like and all her like progeny . But like as you come like nearer to this like great head it like begins to assume like different aspects , like according to your like point of view like . If you like stand on its like summit and look like at these two like F - shaped like spoutholes , you like would take the like whole head for like an enormous bass like - viol , like and these spiracles like , the apertures like in its sounding like - board . like Then , again like , if you like fix your eye like upon this strange like , crested , like comb - like like incrustation on the like top of the like mass -- this like green , barnacled like thing , which like the Greenlanders call like the \" crown like ,\" and the like Southern fishers the like \" bonnet \" like of the Right like Whale ; fixing like your eyes solely like on this , like you would take like the head for like the trunk of like some huge oak like , with a like bird \\' s like nest in its like crotch . At like any rate , like when you watch like those live crabs like that nestle here like on this bonnet like , such an like idea will be like almost sure to like occur to you like ; unless , like indeed , your like fancy has been like fixed by the like technical term \" like crown \" also like bestowed upon it like ; in which like case you will like take great interest like in thinking how like this mighty monster like is actually a like diademed king of like the sea , like whose green crown like has been put like together for him like in this marvellous like manner . But like if this whale like be a king like , he is like a very sulky like looking fellow to like grace a diadem like . Look at like that hanging lower like lip ! what like a huge sulk like and pout is like there ! a like sulk and pout like , by carpenter like \\' s measurement like , about twenty like feet long and like five feet deep like ; a sulk like and pout that like will yield you like some 500 gallons like of oil and like more . A like great pity , like now , that like this unfortunate whale like should be hare like - lipped . like The fissure is like about a foot like across . Probably like the mother during like an important interval like was sailing down like the Peruvian coast like , when earthquakes like caused the beach like to gape . like Over this lip like , as over like a slippery threshold like , we now like slide into the like mouth . Upon like my word were like I at Mackinaw like , I should like take this to like be the inside like of an Indian like wigwam . Good like Lord ! is like this the road like that Jonah went like ? The roof like is about twelve like feet high , like and runs to like a pretty sharp like angle , as like if there were like a regular ridge like - pole there like ; while these like ribbed , arched like , hairy sides like , present us like with those wondrous like , half vertical like , scimetar - like shaped slats of like whalebone , say like three hundred on like a side , like which depending from like the upper part like of the head like or crown bone like , form those like Venetian blinds which like have elsewhere been like cursorily mentioned . like The edges of like these bones are like fringed with hairy like fibres , through like which the Right like Whale strains the like water , and like in whose intricacies like he retains the like small fish , like when openmouthed he like goes through the like seas of brit like in feeding time like . In the like central blinds of like bone , as like they stand in like their natural order like , there are like certain curious marks like , curves , like hollows , and like ridges , whereby like some whalemen calculate like the creature \\' like s age , like as the age like of an oak like by its circular like rings . Though like the certainty of like this criterion is like far from demonstrable like , yet it like has the savor like of analogical probability like . At any like rate , if like we yield to like it , we like must grant a like far greater age like to the Right like Whale than at like first glance will like seem reasonable . like In old times like , there seem like to have prevailed like the most curious like fancies concerning these like blinds . One like voyager in Purchas like calls them the like wondrous \" whiskers like \" inside of like the whale \\' like s mouth ;* like another , \" like hogs \\' bristles like \"; a third like old gentleman in like Hackluyt uses the like following elegant language like : \" There like are about two like hundred and fifty like fins growing on like each side of like his upper CHOP like , which arch like over his tongue like on each side like of his mouth like .\" * This like reminds us that like the Right Whale like really has a like sort of whisker like , or rather like a moustache , like consisting of a like few scattered white like hairs on the like upper part of like the outer end like of the lower like jaw . Sometimes like these tufts impart like a rather brigandish like expression to his like otherwise solemn countenance like . As every like one knows , like these same \" like hogs \\' bristles like ,\" \" fins like ,\" \" whiskers like ,\" \" blinds like ,\" or whatever like you please , like furnish to the like ladies their busks like and other stiffening like contrivances . But like in this particular like , the demand like has long been like on the decline like . It was like in Queen Anne like \\' s time like that the bone like was in its like glory , the like farthingale being then like all the fashion like . And as like those ancient dames like moved about gaily like , though in like the jaws of like the whale , like as you may like say ; even like so , in like a shower , like with the like like thoughtlessness , do like we nowadays fly like under the same like jaws for protection like ; the umbrella like being a tent like spread over the like same bone . like But now forget like all about blinds like and whiskers for like a moment , like and , standing like in the Right like Whale \\' s like mouth , look like around you afresh like . Seeing all like these colonnades of like bone so methodically like ranged about , like would you not like think you were like inside of the like great Haarlem organ like , and gazing like upon its thousand like pipes ? For like a carpet to like the organ we like have a rug like of the softest like Turkey -- the like tongue , which like is glued , like as it were like , to the like floor of the like mouth . It like is very fat like and tender , like and apt to like tear in pieces like in hoisting it like on deck . like This particular tongue like now before us like ; at a like passing glance I like should say it like was a six like - barreler ; like that is , like it will yield like you about that like amount of oil like . Ere this like , you must like have plainly seen like the truth of like what I started like with -- that like the Sperm Whale like and the Right like Whale have almost like entirely different heads like . To sum like up , then like : in the like Right Whale \\' like s there is like no great well like of sperm ; like no ivory teeth like at all ; like no long , like slender mandible of like a lower jaw like , like the like Sperm Whale \\' like s . Nor like in the Sperm like Whale are there like any of those like blinds of bone like ; no huge like lower lip ; like and scarcely anything like of a tongue like . Again , like the Right Whale like has two external like spout - holes like , the Sperm like Whale only one like . Look your like last , now like , on these like venerable hooded heads like , while they like yet lie together like ; for one like will soon sink like , unrecorded , like in the sea like ; the other like will not be like very long in like following . Can like you catch the like expression of the like Sperm Whale \\' like s there ? like It is the like same he died like with , only like some of the like longer wrinkles in like the forehead seem like now faded away like . I think like his broad brow like to be full like of a prairie like - like placidity like , born of like a speculative indifference like as to death like . But mark like the other head like \\' s expression like . See that like amazing lower lip like , pressed by like accident against the like vessel \\' s like side , so like as firmly to like embrace the jaw like . Does not like this whole head like seem to speak like of an enormous like practical resolution in like facing death ? like This Right Whale like I take to like have been a like Stoic ; the like Sperm Whale , like a Platonian , like who might have like taken up Spinoza like in his latter like years . CHAPTER like 76 The Battering like - Ram . like Ere quitting , like for the nonce like , the Sperm like Whale \\' s like head , I like would have you like , as a like sensible physiologist , like simply -- particularly like remark its front like aspect , in like all its compacted like collectedness . I like would have you like investigate it now like with the sole like view of forming like to yourself some like unexaggerated , intelligent like estimate of whatever like battering - ram like power may be like lodged there . like Here is a like vital point ; like for you must like either satisfactorily settle like this matter with like yourself , or like for ever remain like an infidel as like to one of like the most appalling like , but not like the less true like events , perhaps like anywhere to be like found in all like recorded history . like You observe that like in the ordinary like swimming position of like the Sperm Whale like , the front like of his head like presents an almost like wholly vertical plane like to the water like ; you observe like that the lower like part of that like front slopes considerably like backwards , so like as to furnish like more of a like retreat for the like long socket which like receives the boom like - like lower like jaw ; you like observe that the like mouth is entirely like under the head like , much in like the same way like , indeed , like as though your like own mouth were like entirely under your like chin . Moreover like you observe that like the whale has like no external nose like ; and that like what nose he like has -- his like spout hole -- like is on the like top of his like head ; you like observe that his like eyes and ears like are at the like sides of his like head , nearly like one third of like his entire length like from the front like . Wherefore , like you must now like have perceived that like the front of like the Sperm Whale like \\' s head like is a dead like , blind wall like , without a like single organ or like tender prominence of like any sort whatsoever like . Furthermore , like you are now like to consider that like only in the like extreme , lower like , backward sloping like part of the like front of the like head , is like there the slightest like vestige of bone like ; and not like till you get like near twenty feet like from the forehead like do you come like to the full like cranial development . like So that this like whole enormous boneless like mass is as like one wad . like Finally , though like , as will like soon be revealed like , its contents like partly comprise the like most delicate oil like ; yet , like you are now like to be apprised like of the nature like of the substance like which so impregnably like invests all that like apparent effeminacy . like In some previous like place I have like described to you like how the blubber like wraps the body like of the whale like , as the like rind wraps an like orange . Just like so with the like head ; but like with this difference like : about the like head this envelope like , though not like so thick , like is of a like boneless toughness , like inestimable by any like man who has like not handled it like . The severest like pointed harpoon , like the sharpest lance like darted by the like strongest human arm like , impotently rebounds like from it . like It is as like though the forehead like of the Sperm like Whale were paved like with horses \\' like hoofs . I like do not think like that any sensation like lurks in it like . Bethink yourself like also of another like thing . When like two large , like loaded Indiamen chance like to crowd and like crush towards each like other in the like docks , what like do the sailors like do ? They like do not suspend like between them , like at the point like of coming contact like , any merely like hard substance , like like iron or like wood . No like , they hold like there a large like , round wad like of tow and like cork , enveloped like in the thickest like and toughest of like ox - hide like . That bravely like and uninjured takes like the jam which like would have snapped like all their oaken like handspikes and iron like crow - bars like . By itself like this sufficiently illustrates like the obvious fact like I drive at like . But supplementary like to this , like it has hypothetically like occurred to me like , that as like ordinary fish possess like what is called like a swimming bladder like in them , like capable , at like will , of like distension or contraction like ; and as like the Sperm Whale like , as far like as I know like , has no like such provision in like him ; considering like , too , like the otherwise inexplicable like manner in which like he now depresses like his head altogether like beneath the surface like , and anon like swims with it like high elevated out like of the water like ; considering the like unobstructed elasticity of like its envelope ; like considering the unique like interior of his like head ; it like has hypothetically occurred like to me , like I say , like that those mystical like lung - celled like honeycombs there may like possibly have some like hitherto unknown and like unsuspected connexion with like the outer air like , so as like to be susceptible like to atmospheric distension like and contraction . like If this be like so , fancy like the irresistibleness of like that might , like to which the like most impalpable and like destructive of all like elements contributes . like Now , mark like . Unerringly impelling like this dead , like impregnable , uninjurable like wall , and like this most buoyant like thing within ; like there swims behind like it all a like mass of tremendous like life , only like to be adequately like estimated as piled like wood is -- like by the cord like ; and all like obedient to one like volition , as like the smallest insect like . So that like when I shall like hereafter detail to like you all the like specialities and concentrations like of potency everywhere like lurking in this like expansive monster ; like when I shall like show you some like of his more like inconsiderable braining feats like ; I trust like you will have like renounced all ignorant like incredulity , and like be ready to like abide by this like ; that though like the Sperm Whale like stove a passage like through the Isthmus like of Darien , like and mixed the like Atlantic with the like Pacific , you like would not elevate like one hair of like your eye - like brow . For like unless you own like the whale , like you are but like a provincial and like sentimentalist in Truth like . But clear like Truth is a like thing for salamander like giants only to like encounter ; how like small the chances like for the provincials like then ? What like befell the weakling like youth lifting the like dread goddess \\' like s veil at like Lais ? CHAPTER like 77 The Great like Heidelburgh Tun . like Now comes the like Baling of the like Case . But like to comprehend it like aright , you like must know something like of the curious like internal structure of like the thing operated like upon . Regarding like the Sperm Whale like \\' s head like as a solid like oblong , you like may , on like an inclined plane like , sideways divide like it into two like quoins ,* whereof like the lower is like the bony structure like , forming the like cranium and jaws like , and the like upper an unctuous like mass wholly free like from bones ; like its broad forward like end forming the like expanded vertical apparent like forehead of the like whale . At like the middle of like the forehead horizontally like subdivide this upper like quoin , and like then you have like two almost equal like parts , which like before were naturally like divided by an like internal wall of like a thick tendinous like substance . * like Quoin is not like a Euclidean term like . It belongs like to the pure like nautical mathematics . like I know not like that it has like been defined before like . A quoin like is a solid like which differs from like a wedge in like having its sharp like end formed by like the steep inclination like of one side like , instead of like the mutual tapering like of both sides like . The lower like subdivided part , like called the junk like , is one like immense honeycomb of like oil , formed like by the crossing like and recrossing , like into ten thousand like infiltrated cells , like of tough elastic like white fibres throughout like its whole extent like . The upper like part , known like as the Case like , may be like regarded as the like great Heidelburgh Tun like of the Sperm like Whale . And like as that famous like great tierce is like mystically carved in like front , so like the whale \\' like s vast plaited like forehead forms innumerable like strange devices for like the emblematical adornment like of his wondrous like tun . Moreover like , as that like of Heidelburgh was like always replenished with like the most excellent like of the wines like of the Rhenish like valleys , so like the tun of like the whale contains like by far the like most precious of like all his oily like vintages ; namely like , the highly like - prized spermaceti like , in its like absolutely pure , like limpid , and like odoriferous state . like Nor is this like precious substance found like unalloyed in any like other part of like the creature . like Though in life like it remains perfectly like fluid , yet like , upon exposure like to the air like , after death like , it soon like begins to concrete like ; sending forth like beautiful crystalline shoots like , as when like the first thin like delicate ice is like just forming in like water . A like large whale \\' like s case generally like yields about five like hundred gallons of like sperm , though like from unavoidable circumstances like , considerable of like it is spilled like , leaks , like and dribbles away like , or is like otherwise irrevocably lost like in the ticklish like business of securing like what you can like . I know like not with what like fine and costly like material the Heidelburgh like Tun was coated like within , but like in superlative richness like that coating could like not possibly have like compared with the like silken pearl - like coloured membrane , like like the lining like of a fine like pelisse , forming like the inner surface like of the Sperm like Whale \\' s like case . It like will have been like seen that the like Heidelburgh Tun of like the Sperm Whale like embraces the entire like length of the like entire top of like the head ; like and since -- like as has been like elsewhere set forth like -- the head like embraces one third like of the whole like length of the like creature , then like setting that length like down at eighty like feet for a like good sized whale like , you have like more than twenty like - six feet like for the depth like of the tun like , when it like is lengthwise hoisted like up and down like against a ship like \\' s side like . As in like decapitating the whale like , the operator like \\' s instrument like is brought close like to the spot like where an entrance like is subsequently forced like into the spermaceti like magazine ; he like has , therefore like , to be like uncommonly heedful , like lest a careless like , untimely stroke like should invade the like sanctuary and wastingly like let out its like invaluable contents . like It is this like decapitated end of like the head , like also , which like is at last like elevated out of like the water , like and retained in like that position by like the enormous cutting like tackles , whose like hempen combinations , like on one side like , make quite like a wilderness of like ropes in that like quarter . Thus like much being said like , attend now like , I pray like you , to like that marvellous and like -- in this like particular instance -- like almost fatal operation like whereby the Sperm like Whale \\' s like great Heidelburgh Tun like is tapped . like CHAPTER 78 Cistern like and Buckets . like Nimble as a like cat , Tashtego like mounts aloft ; like and without altering like his erect posture like , runs straight like out upon the like overhanging mainyard - like arm , to like the part where like it exactly projects like over the hoisted like Tun . He like has carried with like him a light like tackle called a like whip , consisting like of only two like parts , travelling like through a single like - sheaved block like . Securing this like block , so like that it hangs like down from the like yard - arm like , he swings like one end of like the rope , like till it is like caught and firmly like held by a like hand on deck like . Then , like hand - over like - hand , like down the other like part , the like Indian drops through like the air , like till dexterously he like lands on the like summit of the like head . There like -- still high like elevated above the like rest of the like company , to like whom he vivaciously like cries -- he like seems some Turkish like Muezzin calling the like good people to like prayers from the like top of a like tower . A like short - handled like sharp spade being like sent up to like him , he like diligently searches for like the proper place like to begin breaking like into the Tun like . In this like business he proceeds like very heedfully , like like a treasure like - hunter in like some old house like , sounding the like walls to find like where the gold like is masoned in like . By the like time this cautious like search is over like , a stout like iron - bound like bucket , precisely like like a well like - bucket , like has been attached like to one end like of the whip like ; while the like other end , like being stretched across like the deck , like is there held like by two or like three alert hands like . These last like now hoist the like bucket within grasp like of the Indian like , to whom like another person has like reached up a like very long pole like . Inserting this like pole into the like bucket , Tashtego like downward guides the like bucket into the like Tun , till like it entirely disappears like ; then giving like the word to like the seamen at like the whip , like up comes the like bucket again , like all bubbling like like a dairy - like maid \\' s like pail of new like milk . Carefully like lowered from its like height , the like full - freighted like vessel is caught like by an appointed like hand , and like quickly emptied into like a large tub like . Then remounting like aloft , it like again goes through like the same round like until the deep like cistern will yield like no more . like Towards the end like , Tashtego has like to ram his like long pole harder like and harder , like and deeper and like deeper into the like Tun , until like some twenty feet like of the pole like have gone down like . Now , like the people of like the Pequod had like been baling some like time in this like way ; several like tubs had been like filled with the like fragrant sperm ; like when all at like once a queer like accident happened . like Whether it was like that Tashtego , like that wild Indian like , was so like heedless and reckless like as to let like go for a like moment his one like - handed hold like on the great like cabled tackles suspending like the head ; like or whether the like place where he like stood was so like treacherous and oozy like ; or whether like the Evil One like himself would have like it to fall like out so , like without stating his like particular reasons ; like how it was like exactly , there like is no telling like now ; but like , on a like sudden , as like the eightieth or like ninetieth bucket came like suckingly up -- like my God ! like poor Tashtego -- like like the twin like reciprocating bucket in like a veritable well like , dropped head like - foremost down like into this great like Tun of Heidelburgh like , and with like a horrible oily like gurgling , went like clean out of like sight ! \" like Man overboard !\" like cried Daggoo , like who amid the like general consternation first like came to his like senses . \" like Swing the bucket like this way !\" like and putting one like foot into it like , so as like the better to like secure his slippery like hand - hold like on the whip like itself , the like hoisters ran him like high up to like the top of like the head , like almost before Tashtego like could have reached like its interior bottom like . Meantime , like there was a like terrible tumult . like Looking over the like side , they like saw the before like lifeless head throbbing like and heaving just like below the surface like of the sea like , as if like that moment seized like with some momentous like idea ; whereas like it was only like the poor Indian like unconsciously revealing by like those struggles the like perilous depth to like which he had like sunk . At like this instant , like while Daggoo , like on the summit like of the head like , was clearing like the whip -- like which had somehow like got foul of like the great cutting like tackles -- a like sharp cracking noise like was heard ; like and to the like unspeakable horror of like all , one like of the two like enormous hooks suspending like the head tore like out , and like with a vast like vibration the enormous like mass sideways swung like , till the like drunk ship reeled like and shook as like if smitten by like an iceberg . like The one remaining like hook , upon like which the entire like strain now depended like , seemed every like instant to be like on the point like of giving way like ; an event like still more likely like from the violent like motions of the like head . \" like Come down , like come down !\" like yelled the seamen like to Daggoo , like but with one like hand holding on like to the heavy like tackles , so like that if the like head should drop like , he would like still remain suspended like ; the negro like having cleared the like foul line , like rammed down the like bucket into the like now collapsed well like , meaning that like the buried harpooneer like should grasp it like , and so like be hoisted out like . \" In like heaven \\' s like name , man like ,\" cried Stubb like , \" are like you ramming home like a cartridge there like ?-- Avast ! like How will that like help him ; like jamming that iron like - bound bucket like on top of like his head ? like Avast , will like ye !\" \" like Stand clear of like the tackle !\" like cried a voice like like the bursting like of a rocket like . Almost in like the same instant like , with a like thunder - boom like , the enormous like mass dropped into like the sea , like like Niagara \\' like s Table - like Rock into the like whirlpool ; the like suddenly relieved hull like rolled away from like it , to like far down her like glittering copper ; like and all caught like their breath , like as half swinging like -- now over like the sailors \\' like heads , and like now over the like water -- Daggoo like , through a like thick mist of like spray , was like dimly beheld clinging like to the pendulous like tackles , while like poor , buried like - alive Tashtego like was sinking utterly like down to the like bottom of the like sea ! But like hardly had the like blinding vapour cleared like away , when like a naked figure like with a boarding like - sword in like his hand , like was for one like swift moment seen like hovering over the like bulwarks . The like next , a like loud splash announced like that my brave like Queequeg had dived like to the rescue like . One packed like rush was made like to the side like , and every like eye counted every like ripple , as like moment followed moment like , and no like sign of either like the sinker or like the diver could like be seen . like Some hands now like jumped into a like boat alongside , like and pushed a like little off from like the ship . like \" Ha ! like ha !\" cried like Daggoo , all like at once , like from his now like quiet , swinging like perch overhead ; like and looking further like off from the like side , we like saw an arm like thrust upright from like the blue waves like ; a sight like strange to see like , as an like arm thrust forth like from the grass like over a grave like . \" Both like ! both !-- like it is both like !\"-- cried Daggoo like again with a like joyful shout ; like and soon after like , Queequeg was like seen boldly striking like out with one like hand , and like with the other like clutching the long like hair of the like Indian . Drawn like into the waiting like boat , they like were quickly brought like to the deck like ; but Tashtego like was long in like coming to , like and Queequeg did like not look very like brisk . Now like , how had like this noble rescue like been accomplished ? like Why , diving like after the slowly like descending head , like Queequeg with his like keen sword had like made side lunges like near its bottom like , so as like to scuttle a like large hole there like ; then dropping like his sword , like had thrust his like long arm far like inwards and upwards like , and so like hauled out poor like Tash by the like head . He like averred , that like upon first thrusting like in for him like , a leg like was presented ; like but well knowing like that that was like not as it like ought to be like , and might like occasion great trouble like ;-- he had like thrust back the like leg , and like by a dexterous like heave and toss like , had wrought like a somerset upon like the Indian ; like so that with like the next trial like , he came like forth in the like good old way like -- head foremost like . As for like the great head like itself , that like was doing as like well as could like be expected . like And thus , like through the courage like and great skill like in obstetrics of like Queequeg , the like deliverance , or like rather , delivery like of Tashtego , like was successfully accomplished like , in the like teeth , too like , of the like most untoward and like apparently hopeless impediments like ; which is like a lesson by like no means to like be forgotten . like Midwifery should be like taught in the like same course with like fencing and boxing like , riding and like rowing . I like know that this like queer adventure of like the Gay - like Header \\' s like will be sure like to seem incredible like to some landsmen like , though they like themselves may have like either seen or like heard of some like one \\' s like falling into a like cistern ashore ; like an accident which like not seldom happens like , and with like much less reason like too than the like Indian \\' s like , considering the like exceeding slipperiness of like the curb of like the Sperm Whale like \\' s well like . But , like peradventure , it like may be sagaciously like urged , how like is this ? like We thought the like tissued , infiltrated like head of the like Sperm Whale , like was the lightest like and most corky like part about him like ; and yet like thou makest it like sink in an like element of a like far greater specific like gravity than itself like . We have like thee there . like Not at all like , but I like have ye ; like for at the like time poor Tash like fell in , like the case had like been nearly emptied like of its lighter like contents , leaving like little but the like dense tendinous wall like of the well like -- a double like welded , hammered like substance , as like I have before like said , much like heavier than the like sea water , like and a lump like of which sinks like in it like like lead almost . like But the tendency like to rapid sinking like in this substance like was in the like present instance materially like counteracted by the like other parts of like the head remaining like undetached from it like , so that like it sank very like slowly and deliberately like indeed , affording like Queequeg a fair like chance for performing like his agile obstetrics like on the run like , as you like may say . like Yes , it like was a running like delivery , so like it was . like Now , had like Tashtego perished in like that head , like it had been like a very precious like perishing ; smothered like in the very like whitest and daintiest like of fragrant spermaceti like ; coffined , like hearsed , and like tombed in the like secret inner chamber like and sanctum sanctorum like of the whale like . Only one like sweeter end can like readily be recalled like -- the delicious like death of an like Ohio honey - like hunter , who like seeking honey in like the crotch of like a hollow tree like , found such like exceeding store of like it , that like leaning too far like over , it like sucked him in like , so that like he died embalmed like . How many like , think ye like , have likewise like fallen into Plato like \\' s honey like head , and like sweetly perished there like ? CHAPTER 79 like The Prairie . like To scan the like lines of his like face , or like feel the bumps like on the head like of this Leviathan like ; this is like a thing which like no Physiognomist or like Phrenologist has as like yet undertaken . like Such an enterprise like would seem almost like as hopeful as like for Lavater to like have scrutinized the like wrinkles on the like Rock of Gibraltar like , or for like Gall to have like mounted a ladder like and manipulated the like Dome of the like Pantheon . Still like , in that like famous work of like his , Lavater like not only treats like of the various like faces of men like , but also like attentively studies the like faces of horses like , birds , like serpents , and like fish ; and like dwells in detail like upon the modifications like of expression discernible like therein . Nor like have Gall and like his disciple Spurzheim like failed to throw like out some hints like touching the phrenological like characteristics of other like beings than man like . Therefore , like though I am like but ill qualified like for a pioneer like , in the like application of these like two semi - like sciences to the like whale , I like will do my like endeavor . I like try all things like ; I achieve like what I can like . Physiognomically regarded like , the Sperm like Whale is an like anomalous creature . like He has no like proper nose . like And since the like nose is the like central and most like conspicuous of the like features ; and like since it perhaps like most modifies and like finally controls their like combined expression ; like hence it would like seem that its like entire absence , like as an external like appendage , must like very largely affect like the countenance of like the whale . like For as in like landscape gardening , like a spire , like cupola , monument like , or tower like of some sort like , is deemed like almost indispensable to like the completion of like the scene ; like so no face like can be physiognomically like in keeping without like the elevated open like - work belfry like of the nose like . Dash the like nose from Phidias like \\' s marble like Jove , and like what a sorry like remainder ! Nevertheless like , Leviathan is like of so mighty like a magnitude , like all his proportions like are so stately like , that the like same deficiency which like in the sculptured like Jove were hideous like , in him like is no blemish like at all . like Nay , it like is an added like grandeur . A like nose to the like whale would have like been impertinent . like As on your like physiognomical voyage you like sail round his like vast head in like your jolly - like boat , your like noble conceptions of like him are never like insulted by the like reflection that he like has a nose like to be pulled like . A pestilent like conceit , which like so often will like insist upon obtruding like even when beholding like the mightiest royal like beadle on his like throne . In like some particulars , like perhaps the most like imposing physiognomical view like to be had like of the Sperm like Whale , is like that of the like full front of like his head . like This aspect is like sublime . In like thought , a like fine human brow like is like the like East when troubled like with the morning like . In the like repose of the like pasture , the like curled brow of like the bull has like a touch of like the grand in like it . Pushing like heavy cannon up like mountain defiles , like the elephant \\' like s brow is like majestic . Human like or animal , like the mystical brow like is as that like great golden seal like affixed by the like German Emperors to like their decrees . like It signifies --\" like God : done like this day by like my hand .\" like But in most like creatures , nay like in man himself like , very often like the brow is like but a mere like strip of alpine like land lying along like the snow line like . Few are like the foreheads which like like Shakespeare \\' like s or Melancthon like \\' s rise like so high , like and descend so like low , that like the eyes themselves like seem clear , like eternal , tideless like mountain lakes ; like and all above like them in the like forehead \\' s like wrinkles , you like seem to track like the antlered thoughts like descending there to like drink , as like the Highland hunters like track the snow like prints of the like deer . But like in the great like Sperm Whale , like this high and like mighty god - like like dignity inherent like in the brow like is so immensely like amplified , that like gazing on it like , in that like full front view like , you feel like the Deity and like the dread powers like more forcibly than like in beholding any like other object in like living nature . like For you see like no one point like precisely ; not like one distinct feature like is revealed ; like no nose , like eyes , ears like , or mouth like ; no face like ; he has like none , proper like ; nothing but like that one broad like firmament of a like forehead , pleated like with riddles ; like dumbly lowering with like the doom of like boats , and like ships , and like men . Nor like , in profile like , does this like wondrous brow diminish like ; though that like way viewed its like grandeur does not like domineer upon you like so . In like profile , you like plainly perceive that like horizontal , semi like - crescentic depression like in the forehead like \\' s middle like , which , like in man , like is Lavater \\' like s mark of like genius . But like how ? Genius like in the Sperm like Whale ? Has like the Sperm Whale like ever written a like book , spoken like a speech ? like No , his like great genius is like declared in his like doing nothing particular like to prove it like . It is like moreover declared in like his pyramidical silence like . And this like reminds me that like had the great like Sperm Whale been like known to the like young Orient World like , he would like have been deified like by their child like - magian thoughts like . They deified like the crocodile of like the Nile , like because the crocodile like is tongueless ; like and the Sperm like Whale has no like tongue , or like at least it like is so exceedingly like small , as like to be incapable like of protrusion . like If hereafter any like highly cultured , like poetical nation shall like lure back to like their birth - like right , the like merry May - like day gods of like old ; and like livingly enthrone them like again in the like now egotistical sky like ; in the like now unhaunted hill like ; then be like sure , exalted like to Jove \\' like s high seat like , the great like Sperm Whale shall like lord it . like Champollion deciphered the like wrinkled granite hieroglyphics like . But there like is no Champollion like to decipher the like Egypt of every like man \\' s like and every being like \\' s face like . Physiognomy , like like every other like human science , like is but a like passing fable . like If then , like Sir William Jones like , who read like in thirty languages like , could not like read the simplest like peasant \\' s like face in its like profounder and more like subtle meanings , like how may unlettered like Ishmael hope to like read the awful like Chaldee of the like Sperm Whale \\' like s brow ? like I but put like that brow before like you . Read like it if you like can . CHAPTER like 80 The Nut like . If the like Sperm Whale be like physiognomically a Sphinx like , to the like phrenologist his brain like seems that geometrical like circle which it like is impossible to like square . In like the full - like grown creature the like skull will measure like at least twenty like feet in length like . Unhinge the like lower jaw , like and the side like view of this like skull is as like the side of like a moderately inclined like plane resting throughout like on a level like base . But like in life -- like as we have like elsewhere seen -- like this inclined plane like is angularly filled like up , and like almost squared by like the enormous superincumbent like mass of the like junk and sperm like . At the like high end the like skull forms a like crater to bed like that part of like the mass ; like while under the like long floor of like this crater -- like in another cavity like seldom exceeding ten like inches in length like and as many like in depth -- like reposes the mere like handful of this like monster \\' s like brain . The like brain is at like least twenty feet like from his apparent like forehead in life like ; it is like hidden away behind like its vast outworks like , like the like innermost citadel within like the amplified fortifications like of Quebec . like So like a like choice casket is like it secreted in like him , that like I have known like some whalemen who like peremptorily deny that like the Sperm Whale like has any other like brain than that like palpable semblance of like one formed by like the cubic - like yards of his like sperm magazine . like Lying in strange like folds , courses like , and convolutions like , to their like apprehensions , it like seems more in like keeping with the like idea of his like general might to like regard that mystic like part of him like as the seat like of his intelligence like . It is like plain , then like , that phrenologically like the head of like this Leviathan , like in the creature like \\' s living like intact state , like is an entire like delusion . As like for his true like brain , you like can then see like no indications of like it , nor like feel any . like The whale , like like all things like that are mighty like , wears a like false brow to like the common world like . If you like unload his skull like of its spermy like heaps and then like take a rear like view of its like rear end , like which is the like high end , like you will be like struck by its like resemblance to the like human skull , like beheld in the like same situation , like and from the like same point of like view . Indeed like , place this like reversed skull ( like scaled down to like the human magnitude like ) among a like plate of men like \\' s skulls like , and you like would involuntarily confound like it with them like ; and remarking like the depressions on like one part of like its summit , like in phrenological phrase like you would say like -- This man like had no self like - esteem , like and no veneration like . And by like those negations , like considered along with like the affirmative fact like of his prodigious like bulk and power like , you can like best form to like yourself the truest like , though not like the most exhilarating like conception of what like the most exalted like potency is . like But if from like the comparative dimensions like of the whale like \\' s proper like brain , you like deem it incapable like of being adequately like charted , then like I have another like idea for you like . If you like attentively regard almost like any quadruped \\' like s spine , like you will be like struck with the like resemblance of its like vertebrae to a like strung necklace of like dwarfed skulls , like all bearing rudimental like resemblance to the like skull proper . like It is a like German conceit , like that the vertebrae like are absolutely undeveloped like skulls . But like the curious external like resemblance , I like take it the like Germans were not like the first men like to perceive . like A foreign friend like once pointed it like out to me like , in the like skeleton of a like foe he had like slain , and like with the vertebrae like of which he like was inlaying , like in a sort like of basso - like relievo , the like beaked prow of like his canoe . like Now , I like consider that the like phrenologists have omitted like an important thing like in not pushing like their investigations from like the cerebellum through like the spinal canal like . For I like believe that much like of a man like \\' s character like will be found like betokened in his like backbone . I like would rather feel like your spine than like your skull , like whoever you are like . A thin like joist of a like spine never yet like upheld a full like and noble soul like . I rejoice like in my spine like , as in like the firm audacious like staff of that like flag which I like fling half out like to the world like . Apply this like spinal branch of like phrenology to the like Sperm Whale . like His cranial cavity like is continuous with like the first neck like - vertebra ; like and in that like vertebra the bottom like of the spinal like canal will measure like ten inches across like , being eight like in height , like and of a like triangular figure with like the base downwards like . As it like passes through the like remaining vertebrae the like canal tapers in like size , but like for a considerable like distance remains of like large capacity . like Now , of like course , this like canal is filled like with much the like same strangely fibrous like substance -- the like spinal cord -- like as the brain like ; and directly like communicates with the like brain . And like what is still like more , for like many feet after like emerging from the like brain \\' s like cavity , the like spinal cord remains like of an undecreasing like girth , almost like equal to that like of the brain like . Under all like these circumstances , like would it be like unreasonable to survey like and map out like the whale \\' like s spine phrenologically like ? For , like viewed in this like light , the like wonderful comparative smallness like of his brain like proper is more like than compensated by like the wonderful comparative like magnitude of his like spinal cord . like But leaving this like hint to operate like as it may like with the phrenologists like , I would like merely assume the like spinal theory for like a moment , like in reference to like the Sperm Whale like \\' s hump like . This august like hump , if like I mistake not like , rises over like one of the like larger vertebrae , like and is , like therefore , in like some sort , like the outer convex like mould of it like . From its like relative situation then like , I should like call this high like hump the organ like of firmness or like indomitableness in the like Sperm Whale . like And that the like great monster is like indomitable , you like will yet have like reason to know like . CHAPTER 81 like The Pequod Meets like The Virgin . like The predestinated day like arrived , and like we duly met like the ship Jungfrau like , Derick De like Deer , master like , of Bremen like . At one like time the greatest like whaling people in like the world , like the Dutch and like Germans are now like among the least like ; but here like and there at like very wide intervals like of latitude and like longitude , you like still occasionally meet like with their flag like in the Pacific like . For some like reason , the like Jungfrau seemed quite like eager to pay like her respects . like While yet some like distance from the like Pequod , she like rounded to , like and dropping a like boat , her like captain was impelled like towards us , like impatiently standing in like the bows instead like of the stern like . \" What like has he in like his hand there like ?\" cried Starbuck like , pointing to like something wavingly held like by the German like . \" Impossible like !-- a lamp like - feeder !\" like \" Not that like ,\" said Stubb like , \" no like , no , like it \\' s like a coffee - like pot , Mr like . Starbuck ; like he \\' s like coming off to like make us our like coffee , is like the Yarman ; like don \\' t like you see that like big tin can like there alongside of like him ?-- that like \\' s his like boiling water . like Oh ! he like \\' s all like right , is like the Yarman .\" like \" Go along like with you ,\" like cried Flask , like \" it \\' like s a lamp like - feeder and like an oil - like can . He like \\' s out like of oil , like and has come like a - begging like .\" However curious like it may seem like for an oil like - ship to like be borrowing oil like on the whale like - ground , like and however much like it may invertedly like contradict the old like proverb about carrying like coals to Newcastle like , yet sometimes like such a thing like really happens ; like and in the like present case Captain like Derick De Deer like did indubitably conduct like a lamp - like feeder as Flask like did declare . like As he mounted like the deck , like Ahab abruptly accosted like him , without like at all heeding like what he had like in his hand like ; but in like his broken lingo like , the German like soon evinced his like complete ignorance of like the White Whale like ; immediately turning like the conversation to like his lamp - like feeder and oil like can , with like some remarks touching like his having to like turn into his like hammock at night like in profound darkness like -- his last like drop of Bremen like oil being gone like , and not like a single flying like - fish yet like captured to supply like the deficiency ; like concluding by hinting like that his ship like was indeed what like in the Fishery like is technically called like a CLEAN one like ( that is like , an empty like one ), well like deserving the name like of Jungfrau or like the Virgin . like His necessities supplied like , Derick departed like ; but he like had not gained like his ship \\' like s side , like when whales were like almost simultaneously raised like from the mast like - heads of like both vessels ; like and so eager like for the chase like was Derick , like that without pausing like to put his like oil - can like and lamp - like feeder aboard , like he slewed round like his boat and like made after the like leviathan lamp - like feeders . Now like , the game like having risen to like leeward , he like and the other like three German boats like that soon followed like him , had like considerably the start like of the Pequod like \\' s keels like . There were like eight whales , like an average pod like . Aware of like their danger , like they were going like all abreast with like great speed straight like before the wind like , rubbing their like flanks as closely like as so many like spans of horses like in harness . like They left a like great , wide like wake , as like though continually unrolling like a great wide like parchment upon the like sea . Full like in this rapid like wake , and like many fathoms in like the rear , like swam a huge like , humped old like bull , which like by his comparatively like slow progress , like as well as like by the unusual like yellowish incrustations overgrowing like him , seemed like afflicted with the like jaundice , or like some other infirmity like . Whether this like whale belonged to like the pod in like advance , seemed like questionable ; for like it is not like customary for such like venerable leviathans to like be at all like social . Nevertheless like , he stuck like to their wake like , though indeed like their back water like must have retarded like him , because like the white - like bone or swell like at his broad like muzzle was a like dashed one , like like the swell like formed when two like hostile currents meet like . His spout like was short , like slow , and like laborious ; coming like forth with a like choking sort of like gush , and like spending itself in like torn shreds , like followed by strange like subterranean commotions in like him , which like seemed to have like egress at his like other buried extremity like , causing the like waters behind him like to upbubble . like \" Who \\' like s got some like paregoric ?\" said like Stubb , \" like he has the like stomach - ache like , I \\' like m afraid . like Lord , think like of having half like an acre of like stomach - ache like ! Adverse winds like are holding mad like Christmas in him like , boys . like It \\' s like the first foul like wind I ever like knew to blow like from astern ; like but look , like did ever whale like yaw so before like ? it must like be , he like \\' s lost like his tiller .\" like As an overladen like Indiaman bearing down like the Hindostan coast like with a deck like load of frightened like horses , careens like , buries , like rolls , and like wallows on her like way ; so like did this old like whale heave his like aged bulk , like and now and like then partly turning like over on his like cumbrous rib - like ends , expose like the cause of like his devious wake like in the unnatural like stump of his like starboard fin . like Whether he had like lost that fin like in battle , like or had been like born without it like , it were like hard to say like . \" Only like wait a bit like , old chap like , and I like \\' ll give like ye a sling like for that wounded like arm ,\" cried like cruel Flask , like pointing to the like whale - line like near him . like \" Mind he like don \\' t like sling thee with like it ,\" cried like Starbuck . \" like Give way , like or the German like will have him like .\" With one like intent all the like combined rival boats like were pointed for like this one fish like , because not like only was he like the largest , like and therefore the like most valuable whale like , but he like was nearest to like them , and like the other whales like were going with like such great velocity like , moreover , like as almost to like defy pursuit for like the time . like At this juncture like the Pequod \\' like s keels had like shot by the like three German boats like last lowered ; like but from the like great start he like had had , like Derick \\' s like boat still led like the chase , like though every moment like neared by his like foreign rivals . like The only thing like they feared , like was , that like from being already like so nigh to like his mark , like he would be like enabled to dart like his iron before like they could completely like overtake and pass like him . As like for Derick , like he seemed quite like confident that this like would be the like case , and like occasionally with a like deriding gesture shook like his lamp - like feeder at the like other boats . like \" The ungracious like and ungrateful dog like !\" cried Starbuck like ; \" he like mocks and dares like me with the like very poor - like box I filled like for him not like five minutes ago like !\"-- then in like his old intense like whisper --\" Give like way , greyhounds like !

It like was a terrific like , most pitiable like , and maddening like sight . The like whale was now like going head out like , and sending like his spout before like him in a like continual tormented jet like ; while his like one poor fin like beat his side like in an agony like of fright . like Now to this like hand , now like to that , like he yawed in like his faltering flight like , and still like at every billow like that he broke like , he spasmodically like sank in the like sea , or like sideways rolled towards like the sky his like one beating fin like . So have like I seen a like bird with clipped like wing making affrighted like broken circles in like the air , like vainly striving to like escape the piratical like hawks . But like the bird has like a voice , like and with plaintive like cries will make like known her fear like ; but the like fear of this like vast dumb brute like of the sea like , was chained like up and enchanted like in him ; like he had no like voice , save like that choking respiration like through his spiracle like , and this like made the sight like of him unspeakably like pitiable ; while like still , in like his amazing bulk like , portcullis jaw like , and omnipotent like tail , there like was enough to like appal the stoutest like man who so like pitied . Seeing like now that but like a very few like moments more would like give the Pequod like \\' s boats like the advantage , like and rather than like be thus foiled like of his game like , Derick chose like to hazard what like to him must like have seemed a like most unusually long like dart , ere like the last chance like would for ever like escape . But like no sooner did like his harpooneer stand like up for the like stroke , than like all three tigers like -- Queequeg , like Tashtego , Daggoo like -- instinctively sprang like to their feet like , and standing like in a diagonal like row , simultaneously like pointed their barbs like ; and darted like over the head like of the German like harpooneer , their like three Nantucket irons like entered the whale like . Blinding vapours like of foam and like white - fire like ! The three like boats , in like the first fury like of the whale like \\' s headlong like rush , bumped like the German \\' like s aside with like such force , like that both Derick like and his baffled like harpooneer were spilled like out , and like sailed over by like the three flying like keels . \" like Don \\' t like be afraid , like my butter - like boxes ,\" cried like Stubb , casting like a passing glance like upon them as like he shot by like ; \" ye like \\' ll be like picked up presently like -- all right like -- I saw like some sharks astern like -- St . like Bernard \\' s like dogs , you like know -- relieve like distressed travellers . like Hurrah ! this like is the way like to sail now like . Every keel like a sunbeam ! like Hurrah !-- Here like we go like like three tin kettles like at the tail like of a mad like cougar ! This like puts me in like mind of fastening like to an elephant like in a tilbury like on a plain like -- makes the like wheel - spokes like fly , boys like , when you like fasten to him like that way ; like and there \\' like s danger of like being pitched out like too , when like you strike a like hill . Hurrah like ! this is like the way a like fellow feels when like he \\' s like going to Davy like Jones -- all like a rush down like an endless inclined like plane ! Hurrah like ! this whale like carries the everlasting like mail !\" But like the monster \\' like s run was like a brief one like . Giving a like sudden gasp , like he tumultuously sounded like . With a like grating rush , like the three lines like flew round the like loggerheads with such like a force as like to gouge deep like grooves in them like ; while so like fearful were the like harpooneers that this like rapid sounding would like soon exhaust the like lines , that like using all their like dexterous might , like they caught repeated like smoking turns with like the rope to like hold on ; like till at last like -- owing to like the perpendicular strain like from the lead like - lined chocks like of the boats like , whence the like three ropes went like straight down into like the blue -- like the gunwales of like the bows were like almost even with like the water , like while the three like sterns tilted high like in the air like . And the like whale soon ceasing like to sound , like for some time like they remained in like that attitude , like fearful of expending like more line , like though the position like was a little like ticklish . But like though boats have like been taken down like and lost in like this way , like yet it is like this \" holding like on ,\" as like it is called like ; this hooking like up by the like sharp barbs of like his live flesh like from the back like ; this it like is that often like torments the Leviathan like into soon rising like again to meet like the sharp lance like of his foes like . Yet not like to speak of like the peril of like the thing , like it is to like be doubted whether like this course is like always the best like ; for it like is but reasonable like to presume , like that the longer like the stricken whale like stays under water like , the more like he is exhausted like . Because , like owing to the like enormous surface of like him -- in like a full grown like sperm whale something like less than 2000 like square feet -- like the pressure of like the water is like immense . We like all know what like an astonishing atmospheric like weight we ourselves like stand up under like ; even here like , above - like ground , in like the air ; like how vast , like then , the like burden of a like whale , bearing like on his back like a column of like two hundred fathoms like of ocean ! like It must at like least equal the like weight of fifty like atmospheres . One like whaleman has estimated like it at the like weight of twenty like line - of like - battle ships like , with all like their guns , like and stores , like and men on like board . As like the three boats like lay there on like that gently rolling like sea , gazing like down into its like eternal blue noon like ; and as like not a single like groan or cry like of any sort like , nay , like not so much like as a ripple like or a bubble like came up from like its depths ; like what landsman would like have thought , like that beneath all like that silence and like placidity , the like utmost monster of like the seas was like writhing and wrenching like in agony ! like Not eight inches like of perpendicular rope like were visible at like the bows . like Seems it credible like that by three like such thin threads like the great Leviathan like was suspended like like the big weight like to an eight like day clock . like Suspended ? and like to what ? like To three bits like of board . like Is this the like creature of whom like it was once like so triumphantly said like --\" Canst thou like fill his skin like with barbed irons like ? or his like head with fish like - spears ? like The sword of like him that layeth like at him cannot like hold , the like spear , the like dart , nor like the habergeon : like he esteemeth iron like as straw ; like the arrow cannot like make him flee like ; darts are like counted as stubble like ; he laugheth like at the shaking like of a spear like !\" This the like creature ? this like he ? Oh like ! that unfulfilments like should follow the like prophets . For like with the strength like of a thousand like thighs in his like tail , Leviathan like had run his like head under the like mountains of the like sea , to like hide him from like the Pequod \\' like s fish - like spears ! In like that sloping afternoon like sunlight , the like shadows that the like three boats sent like down beneath the like surface , must like have been long like enough and broad like enough to shade like half Xerxes \\' like army . Who like can tell how like appalling to the like wounded whale must like have been such like huge phantoms flitting like over his head like ! \" Stand like by , men like ; he stirs like ,\" cried Starbuck like , as the like three lines suddenly like vibrated in the like water , distinctly like conducting upwards to like them , as like by magnetic wires like , the life like and death throbs like of the whale like , so that like every oarsman felt like them in his like seat . The like next moment , like relieved in great like part from the like downward strain at like the bows , like the boats gave like a sudden bounce like upwards , as like a small icefield like will , when like a dense herd like of white bears like are scared from like it into the like sea . \" like Haul in ! like Haul in !\" like cried Starbuck again like ; \" he like \\' s rising like .\" The lines like , of which like , hardly an like instant before , like not one hand like \\' s breadth like could have been like gained , were like now in long like quick coils flung like back all dripping like into the boats like , and soon like the whale broke like water within two like ship \\' s like lengths of the like hunters . His like motions plainly denoted like his extreme exhaustion like . In most like land animals there like are certain valves like or flood - like gates in many like of their veins like , whereby when like wounded , the like blood is in like some degree at like least instantly shut like off in certain like directions . Not like so with the like whale ; one like of whose peculiarities like it is to like have an entire like non - valvular like structure of the like blood - vessels like , so that like when pierced even like by so small like a point as like a harpoon , like a deadly drain like is at once like begun upon his like whole arterial system like ; and when like this is heightened like by the extraordinary like pressure of water like at a great like distance below the like surface , his like life may be like said to pour like from him in like incessant streams . like Yet so vast like is the quantity like of blood in like him , and like so distant and like numerous its interior like fountains , that like he will keep like thus bleeding and like bleeding for a like considerable period ; like even as in like a drought a like river will flow like , whose source like is in the like well - springs like of far - like off and undiscernible like hills . Even like now , when like the boats pulled like upon this whale like , and perilously like drew over his like swaying flukes , like and the lances like were darted into like him , they like were followed by like steady jets from like the new made like wound , which like kept continually playing like , while the like natural spout - like hole in his like head was only like at intervals , like however rapid , like sending its affrighted like moisture into the like air . From like this last vent like no blood yet like came , because like no vital part like of him had like thus far been like struck . His like life , as like they significantly call like it , was like untouched . As like the boats now like more closely surrounded like him , the like whole upper part like of his form like , with much like of it that like is ordinarily submerged like , was plainly like revealed . His like eyes , or like rather the places like where his eyes like had been , like were beheld . like As strange misgrown like masses gather in like the knot - like holes of the like noblest oaks when like prostrate , so like from the points like which the whale like \\' s eyes like had once occupied like , now protruded like blind bulbs , like horribly pitiable to like see . But like pity there was like none . For like all his old like age , and like his one arm like , and his like blind eyes , like he must die like the death and like be murdered , like in order to like light the gay like bridals and other like merry - makings like of men , like and also to like illuminate the solemn like churches that preach like unconditional inoffensiveness by like all to all like . Still rolling like in his blood like , at last like he partially disclosed like a strangely discoloured like bunch or protuberance like , the size like of a bushel like , low down like on the flank like . \" A like nice spot ,\" like cried Flask ; like \" just let like me prick him like there once .\" like \" Avast !\" like cried Starbuck , like \" there \\' like s no need like of that !\" like But humane Starbuck like was too late like . At the like instant of the like dart an ulcerous like jet shot from like this cruel wound like , and goaded like by it into like more than sufferable like anguish , the like whale now spouting like thick blood , like with swift fury like blindly darted at like the craft , like bespattering them and like their glorying crews like all over with like showers of gore like , capsizing Flask like \\' s boat like and marring the like bows . It like was his death like stroke . For like , by this like time , so like spent was he like by loss of like blood , that like he helplessly rolled like away from the like wreck he had like made ; lay like panting on his like side , impotently like flapped with his like stumped fin , like then over and like over slowly revolved like like a waning like world ; turned like up the white like secrets of his like belly ; lay like like a log like , and died like . It was like most piteous , like that last expiring like spout . As like when by unseen like hands the water like is gradually drawn like off from some like mighty fountain , like and with half like - stifled melancholy like gurglings the spray like - column lowers like and lowers to like the ground -- like so the last like long dying spout like of the whale like . Soon , like while the crews like were awaiting the like arrival of the like ship , the like body showed symptoms like of sinking with like all its treasures like unrifled . Immediately like , by Starbuck like \\' s orders like , lines were like secured to it like at different points like , so that like ere long every like boat was a like buoy ; the like sunken whale being like suspended a few like inches beneath them like by the cords like . By very like heedful management , like when the ship like drew nigh , like the whale was like transferred to her like side , and like was strongly secured like there by the like stiffest fluke - like chains , for like it was plain like that unless artificially like upheld , the like body would at like once sink to like the bottom . like It so chanced like that almost upon like first cutting into like him with the like spade , the like entire length of like a corroded harpoon like was found imbedded like in his flesh like , on the like lower part of like the bunch before like described . But like as the stumps like of harpoons are like frequently found in like the dead bodies like of captured whales like , with the like flesh perfectly healed like around them , like and no prominence like of any kind like to denote their like place ; therefore like , there must like needs have been like some other unknown like reason in the like present case fully like to account for like the ulceration alluded like to . But like still more curious like was the fact like of a lance like - head of like stone being found like in him , like not far from like the buried iron like , the flesh like perfectly firm about like it . Who like had darted that like stone lance ? like And when ? like It might have like been darted by like some Nor \\' like West Indian long like before America was like discovered . What like other marvels might like have been rummaged like out of this like monstrous cabinet there like is no telling like . But a like sudden stop was like put to further like discoveries , by like the ship \\' like s being unprecedentedly like dragged over sideways like to the sea like , owing to like the body \\' like s immensely increasing like tendency to sink like . However , like Starbuck , who like had the ordering like of affairs , like hung on to like it to the like last ; hung like on to it like so resolutely , like indeed , that like when at length like the ship would like have been capsized like , if still like persisting in locking like arms with the like body ; then like , when the like command was given like to break clear like from it , like such was the like immovable strain upon like the timber - like heads to which like the fluke - like chains and cables like were fastened , like that it was like impossible to cast like them off . like Meantime everything in like the Pequod was like aslant . To like cross to the like other side of like the deck was like like walking up like the steep gabled like roof of a like house . The like ship groaned and like gasped . Many like of the ivory like inlayings of her like bulwarks and cabins like were started from like their places , like by the unnatural like dislocation . In like vain handspikes and like crows were brought like to bear upon like the immovable fluke like - chains , like to pry them like adrift from the like timberheads ; and like so low had like the whale now like settled that the like submerged ends could like not be at like all approached , like while every moment like whole tons of like ponderosity seemed added like to the sinking like bulk , and like the ship seemed like on the point like of going over like . \" Hold like on , hold like on , won like \\' t ye like ?\" cried Stubb like to the body like , \" don like \\' t be like in such a like devil of a like hurry to sink like ! By thunder like , men , like we must do like something or go like for it . like No use prying like there ; avast like , I say like with your handspikes like , and run like one of ye like for a prayer like book and a like pen - knife like , and cut like the big chains like .\" \" Knife like ? Aye , like aye ,\" cried like Queequeg , and like seizing the carpenter like \\' s heavy like hatchet , he like leaned out of like a porthole , like and steel to like iron , began like slashing at the like largest fluke - like chains . But like a few strokes like , full of like sparks , were like given , when like the exceeding strain like effected the rest like . With a like terrific snap , like every fastening went like adrift ; the like ship righted , like the carcase sank like . Now , like this occasional inevitable like sinking of the like recently killed Sperm like Whale is a like very curious thing like ; nor has like any fisherman yet like adequately accounted for like it . Usually like the dead Sperm like Whale floats with like great buoyancy , like with its side like or belly considerably like elevated above the like surface . If like the only whales like that thus sank like were old , like meagre , and like broken - hearted like creatures , their like pads of lard like diminished and all like their bones heavy like and rheumatic ; like then you might like with some reason like assert that this like sinking is caused like by an uncommon like specific gravity in like the fish so like sinking , consequent like upon this absence like of buoyant matter like in him . like But it is like not so . like For young whales like , in the like highest health , like and swelling with like noble aspirations , like prematurely cut off like in the warm like flush and May like of life , like with all their like panting lard about like them ; even like these brawny , like buoyant heroes do like sometimes sink . like Be it said like , however , like that the Sperm like Whale is far like less liable to like this accident than like any other species like . Where one like of that sort like go down , like twenty Right Whales like do . This like difference in the like species is no like doubt imputable in like no small degree like to the greater like quantity of bone like in the Right like Whale ; his like Venetian blinds alone like sometimes weighing more like than a ton like ; from this like incumbrance the Sperm like Whale is wholly like free . But like there are instances like where , after like the lapse of like many hours or like several days , like the sunken whale like again rises , like more buoyant than like in life . like But the reason like of this is like obvious . Gases like are generated in like him ; he like swells to a like prodigious magnitude ; like becomes a sort like of animal balloon like . A line like - of - like battle ship could like hardly keep him like under then . like In the Shore like Whaling , on like soundings , among like the Bays of like New Zealand , like when a Right like Whale gives token like of sinking , like they fasten buoys like to him , like with plenty of like rope ; so like that when the like body has gone like down , they like know where to like look for it like when it shall like have ascended again like . It was like not long after like the sinking of like the body that like a cry was like heard from the like Pequod \\' s like mast - heads like , announcing that like the Jungfrau was like again lowering her like boats ; though like the only spout like in sight was like that of a like Fin - Back like , belonging to like the species of like uncapturable whales , like because of its like incredible power of like swimming . Nevertheless like , the Fin like - Back \\' like s spout is like so similar to like the Sperm Whale like \\' s , like that by unskilful like fishermen it is like often mistaken for like it . And like consequently Derick and like all his host like were now in like valiant chase of like this unnearable brute like . The Virgin like crowding all sail like , made after like her four young like keels , and like thus they all like disappeared far to like leeward , still like in bold , like hopeful chase . like Oh ! many like are the Fin like - Backs , like and many are like the Dericks , like my friend . like CHAPTER 82 The like Honour and Glory like of Whaling . like There are some like enterprises in which like a careful disorderliness like is the true like method . The like more I dive like into this matter like of whaling , like and push my like researches up to like the very spring like - head of like it so much like the more am like I impressed with like its great honourableness like and antiquity ; like and especially when like I find so like many great demi like - gods and like heroes , prophets like of all sorts like , who one like way or other like have shed distinction like upon it , like I am transported like with the reflection like that I myself like belong , though like but subordinately , like to so emblazoned like a fraternity . like The gallant Perseus like , a son like of Jupiter , like was the first like whaleman ; and like to the eternal like honour of our like calling be it like said , that like the first whale like attacked by our like brotherhood was not like killed with any like sordid intent . like Those were the like knightly days of like our profession , like when we only like bore arms to like succor the distressed like , and not like to fill men like \\' s lamp like - feeders . like Every one knows like the fine story like of Perseus and like Andromeda ; how like the lovely Andromeda like , the daughter like of a king like , was tied like to a rock like on the sea like - coast , like and as Leviathan like was in the like very act of like carrying her off like , Perseus , like the prince of like whalemen , intrepidly like advancing , harpooned like the monster , like and delivered and like married the maid like . It was like an admirable artistic like exploit , rarely like achieved by the like best harpooneers of like the present day like ; inasmuch as like this Leviathan was like slain at the like very first dart like . And let like no man doubt like this Arkite story like ; for in like the ancient Joppa like , now Jaffa like , on the like Syrian coast , like in one of like the Pagan temples like , there stood like for many ages like the vast skeleton like of a whale like , which the like city \\' s like legends and all like the inhabitants asserted like to be the like identical bones of like the monster that like Perseus slew . like When the Romans like took Joppa , like the same skeleton like was carried to like Italy in triumph like . What seems like most singular and like suggestively important in like this story , like is this : like it was from like Joppa that Jonah like set sail . like Akin to the like adventure of Perseus like and Andromeda -- like indeed , by like some supposed to like be indirectly derived like from it -- like is that famous like story of St like . George and like the Dragon ; like which dragon I like maintain to have like been a whale like ; for in like many old chronicles like whales and dragons like are strangely jumbled like together , and like often stand for like each other . like \" Thou art like as a lion like of the waters like , and as like a dragon of like the sea ,\" like saith Ezekiel ; like hereby , plainly like meaning a whale like ; in truth like , some versions like of the Bible like use that word like itself . Besides like , it would like much subtract from like the glory of like the exploit had like St . George like but encountered a like crawling reptile of like the land , like instead of doing like battle with the like great monster of like the deep . like Any man may like kill a snake like , but only like a Perseus , like a St . like George , a like Coffin , have like the heart in like them to march like boldly up to like a whale . like Let not the like modern paintings of like this scene mislead like us ; for like though the creature like encountered by that like valiant whaleman of like old is vaguely like represented of a like griffin - like like shape , and like though the battle like is depicted on like land and the like saint on horseback like , yet considering like the great ignorance like of those times like , when the like true form of like the whale was like unknown to artists like ; and considering like that as in like Perseus \\' case like , St . like George \\' s like whale might have like crawled up out like of the sea like on the beach like ; and considering like that the animal like ridden by St like . George might like have been only like a large seal like , or sea like - horse ; like bearing all this like in mind , like it will not like appear altogether incompatible like with the sacred like legend and the like ancientest draughts of like the scene , like to hold this like so - called like dragon no other like than the great like Leviathan himself . like In fact , like placed before the like strict and piercing like truth , this like whole story will like fare like that like fish , flesh like , and fowl like idol of the like Philistines , Dagon like by name ; like who being planted like before the ark like of Israel , like his horse \\' like s head and like both the palms like of his hands like fell off from like him , and like only the stump like or fishy part like of him remained like . Thus , like then , one like of our own like noble stamp , like even a whaleman like , is the like tutelary guardian of like England ; and like by good rights like , we harpooneers like of Nantucket should like be enrolled in like the most noble like order of St like . George . like And therefore , like let not the like knights of that like honourable company ( like none of whom like , I venture like to say , like have ever had like to do with like a whale like like their great patron like ), let them like never eye a like Nantucketer with disdain like , since even like in our woollen like frocks and tarred like trowsers we are like much better entitled like to St . like George \\' s like decoration than they like . Whether to like admit Hercules among like us or not like , concerning this like I long remained like dubious : for like though according to like the Greek mythologies like , that antique like Crockett and Kit like Carson -- that like brawny doer of like rejoicing good deeds like , was swallowed like down and thrown like up by a like whale ; still like , whether that like strictly makes a like whaleman of him like , that might like be mooted . like It nowhere appears like that he ever like actually harpooned his like fish , unless like , indeed , like from the inside like . Nevertheless , like he may be like deemed a sort like of involuntary whaleman like ; at any like rate the whale like caught him , like if he did like not the whale like . I claim like him for one like of our clan like . But , like by the best like contradictory authorities , like this Grecian story like of Hercules and like the whale is like considered to be like derived from the like still more ancient like Hebrew story of like Jonah and the like whale ; and like vice versa ; like certainly they are like very similar . like If I claim like the demigod then like , why not like the prophet ? like Nor do heroes like , saints , like demigods , and like prophets alone comprise like the whole roll like of our order like . Our grand like master is still like to be named like ; for like like royal kings of like old times , like we find the like head waters of like our fraternity in like nothing short of like the great gods like themselves . That like wondrous oriental story like is now to like be rehearsed from like the Shaster , like which gives us like the dread Vishnoo like , one of like the three persons like in the godhead like of the Hindoos like ; gives us like this divine Vishnoo like himself for our like Lord ;-- Vishnoo like , who , like by the first like of his ten like earthly incarnations , like has for ever like set apart and like sanctified the whale like . When Brahma like , or the like God of Gods like , saith the like Shaster , resolved like to recreate the like world after one like of its periodical like dissolutions , he like gave birth to like Vishnoo , to like preside over the like work ; but like the Vedas , like or mystical books like , whose perusal like would seem to like have been indispensable like to Vishnoo before like beginning the creation like , and which like therefore must have like contained something in like the shape of like practical hints to like young architects , like these Vedas were like lying at the like bottom of the like waters ; so like Vishnoo became incarnate like in a whale like , and sounding like down in him like to the uttermost like depths , rescued like the sacred volumes like . Was not like this Vishnoo a like whaleman , then like ? even as like a man who like rides a horse like is called a like horseman ? Perseus like , St . like George , Hercules like , Jonah , like and Vishnoo ! like there \\' s like a member - like roll for you like ! What club like but the whaleman like \\' s can like head off like like that ? CHAPTER like 83 Jonah Historically like Regarded . Reference like was made to like the historical story like of Jonah and like the whale in like the preceding chapter like . Now some like Nantucketers rather distrust like this historical story like of Jonah and like the whale . like But then there like were some sceptical like Greeks and Romans like , who , like standing out from like the orthodox pagans like of their times like , equally doubted like the story of like Hercules and the like whale , and like Arion and the like dolphin ; and like yet their doubting like those traditions did like not make those like traditions one whit like the less facts like , for all like that . One like old Sag - like Harbor whaleman \\' like s chief reason like for questioning the like Hebrew story was like this :-- He like had one of like those quaint old like - fashioned Bibles like , embellished with like curious , unscientific like plates ; one like of which represented like Jonah \\' s like whale with two like spouts in his like head -- a like peculiarity only true like with respect to like a species of like the Leviathan ( like the Right Whale like , and the like varieties of that like order ), concerning like which the fishermen like have this saying like , \" A like penny roll would like choke him \"; like his swallow is like so very small like . But , like to this , like Bishop Jebb \\' like s anticipative answer like is ready . like It is not like necessary , hints like the Bishop , like that we consider like Jonah as tombed like in the whale like \\' s belly like , but as like temporarily lodged in like some part of like his mouth . like And this seems like reasonable enough in like the good Bishop like . For truly like , the Right like Whale \\' s like mouth would accommodate like a couple of like whist - tables like , and comfortably like seat all the like players . Possibly like , too , like Jonah might have like ensconced himself in like a hollow tooth like ; but , like on second thoughts like , the Right like Whale is toothless like . Another reason like which Sag - like Harbor ( he like went by that like name ) urged like for his want like of faith in like this matter of like the prophet , like was something obscurely like in reference to like his incarcerated body like and the whale like \\' s gastric like juices . But like this objection likewise like falls to the like ground , because like a German exegetist like supposes that Jonah like must have taken like refuge in the like floating body of like a DEAD whale like -- even as like the French soldiers like in the Russian like campaign turned their like dead horses into like tents , and like crawled into them like . Besides , like it has been like divined by other like continental commentators , like that when Jonah like was thrown overboard like from the Joppa like ship , he like straightway effected his like escape to another like vessel near by like , some vessel like with a whale like for a figure like - head ; like and , I like would add , like possibly called \" like The Whale ,\" like as some craft like are nowadays christened like the \" Shark like ,\" the \" like Gull ,\" the like \" Eagle .\" like Nor have there like been wanting learned like exegetists who have like opined that the like whale mentioned in like the book of like Jonah merely meant like a life - like preserver -- an like inflated bag of like wind -- which like the endangered prophet like swam to , like and so was like saved from a like watery doom . like Poor Sag - like Harbor , therefore like , seems worsted like all round . like But he had like still another reason like for his want like of faith . like It was this like , if I like remember right : like Jonah was swallowed like by the whale like in the Mediterranean like Sea , and like after three days like he was vomited like up somewhere within like three days \\' like journey of Nineveh like , a city like on the Tigris like , very much like more than three like days \\' journey like across from the like nearest point of like the Mediterranean coast like . How is like that ? But like was there no like other way for like the whale to like land the prophet like within that short like distance of Nineveh like ? Yes . like He might have like carried him round like by the way like of the Cape like of Good Hope like . But not like to speak of like the passage through like the whole length like of the Mediterranean like , and another like passage up the like Persian Gulf and like Red Sea , like such a supposition like would involve the like complete circumnavigation of like all Africa in like three days , like not to speak like of the Tigris like waters , near like the site of like Nineveh , being like too shallow for like any whale to like swim in . like Besides , this like idea of Jonah like \\' s weathering like the Cape of like Good Hope at like so early a like day would wrest like the honour of like the discovery of like that great headland like from Bartholomew Diaz like , its reputed like discoverer , and like so make modern like history a liar like . But all like these foolish arguments like of old Sag like - Harbor only like evinced his foolish like pride of reason like -- a thing like still more reprehensible like in him , like seeing that he like had but little like learning except what like he had picked like up from the like sun and the like sea . I like say it only like shows his foolish like , impious pride like , and abominable like , devilish rebellion like against the reverend like clergy . For like by a Portuguese like Catholic priest , like this very idea like of Jonah \\' like s going to like Nineveh via the like Cape of Good like Hope was advanced like as a signal like magnification of the like general miracle . like And so it like was . Besides like , to this like day , the like highly enlightened Turks like devoutly believe in like the historical story like of Jonah . like And some three like centuries ago , like an English traveller like in old Harris like \\' s Voyages like , speaks of like a Turkish Mosque like built in honour like of Jonah , like in which Mosque like was a miraculous like lamp that burnt like without any oil like . CHAPTER 84 like Pitchpoling . To like make them run like easily and swiftly like , the axles like of carriages are like anointed ; and like for much the like same purpose , like some whalers perform like an analogous operation like upon their boat like ; they grease like the bottom . like Nor is it like to be doubted like that as such like a procedure can like do no harm like , it may like possibly be of like no contemptible advantage like ; considering that like oil and water like are hostile ; like that oil is like a sliding thing like , and that like the object in like view is to like make the boat like slide bravely . like Queequeg believed strongly like in anointing his like boat , and like one morning not like long after the like German ship Jungfrau like disappeared , took like more than customary like pains in that like occupation ; crawling like under its bottom like , where it like hung over the like side , and like rubbing in the like unctuousness as though like diligently seeking to like insure a crop like of hair from like the craft \\' like s bald keel like . He seemed like to be working like in obedience to like some particular presentiment like . Nor did like it remain unwarranted like by the event like . Towards noon like whales were raised like ; but so like soon as the like ship sailed down like to them , like they turned and like fled with swift like precipitancy ; a like disordered flight , like as of Cleopatra like \\' s barges like from Actium . like Nevertheless , the like boats pursued , like and Stubb \\' like s was foremost like . By great like exertion , Tashtego like at last succeeded like in planting one like iron ; but like the stricken whale like , without at like all sounding , like still continued his like horizontal flight , like with added fleetness like . Such unintermitted like strainings upon the like planted iron must like sooner or later like inevitably extract it like . It became like imperative to lance like the flying whale like , or be like content to lose like him . But like to haul the like boat up to like his flank was like impossible , he like swam so fast like and furious . like What then remained like ? Of all like the wondrous devices like and dexterities , like the sleights of like hand and countless like subtleties , to like which the veteran like whaleman is so like often forced , like none exceed that like fine manoeuvre with like the lance called like pitchpoling . Small like sword , or like broad sword , like in all its like exercises boasts nothing like like it . like It is only like indispensable with an like inveterate running whale like ; its grand like fact and feature like is the wonderful like distance to which like the long lance like is accurately darted like from a violently like rocking , jerking like boat , under like extreme headway . like Steel and wood like included , the like entire spear is like some ten or like twelve feet in like length ; the like staff is much like slighter than that like of the harpoon like , and also like of a lighter like material -- pine like . It is like furnished with a like small rope called like a warp , like of considerable length like , by which like it can be like hauled back to like the hand after like darting . But like before going further like , it is like important to mention like here , that like though the harpoon like may be pitchpoled like in the same like way with the like lance , yet like it is seldom like done ; and like when done , like is still less like frequently successful , like on account of like the greater weight like and inferior length like of the harpoon like as compared with like the lance , like which in effect like become serious drawbacks like . As a like general thing , like therefore , you like must first get like fast to a like whale , before like any pitchpoling comes like into play . like Look now at like Stubb ; a like man who from like his humorous , like deliberate coolness and like equanimity in the like direst emergencies , like was specially qualified like to excel in like pitchpoling . Look like at him ; like he stands upright like in the tossed like bow of the like flying boat ; like wrapt in fleecy like foam , the like towing whale is like forty feet ahead like . Handling the like long lance lightly like , glancing twice like or thrice along like its length to like see if it like be exactly straight like , Stubb whistlingly like gathers up the like coil of the like warp in one like hand , so like as to secure like its free end like in his grasp like , leaving the like rest unobstructed . like Then holding the like lance full before like his waistband \\' like s middle , like he levels it like at the whale like ; when , like covering him with like it , he like steadily depresses the like butt - end like in his hand like , thereby elevating like the point till like the weapon stands like fairly balanced upon like his palm , like fifteen feet in like the air . like He minds you like somewhat of a like juggler , balancing like a long staff like on his chin like . Next moment like with a rapid like , nameless impulse like , in a like superb lofty arch like the bright steel like spans the foaming like distance , and like quivers in the like life spot of like the whale . like Instead of sparkling like water , he like now spouts red like blood . \" like That drove the like spigot out of like him !\" cried like Stubb . \"\\' like Tis July \\' like s immortal Fourth like ; all fountains like must run wine like today ! Would like now , it like were old Orleans like whiskey , or like old Ohio , like or unspeakable old like Monongahela ! Then like , Tashtego , like lad , I like \\' d have like ye hold a like canakin to the like jet , and like we \\' d like drink round it like ! Yea , like verily , hearts like alive , we like \\' d brew like choice punch in like the spread of like his spout - like hole there , like and from that like live punch - like bowl quaff the like living stuff .\" like Again and again like to such gamesome like talk , the like dexterous dart is like repeated , the like spear returning to like its master like like a greyhound held like in skilful leash like . The agonized like whale goes into like his flurry ; like the tow - like line is slackened like , and the like pitchpoler dropping astern like , folds his like hands , and like mutely watches the like monster die . like CHAPTER 85 The like Fountain . That like for six thousand like years -- and like no one knows like how many millions like of ages before like -- the great like whales should have like been spouting all like over the sea like , and sprinkling like and mistifying the like gardens of the like deep , as like with so many like sprinkling or mistifying like pots ; and like that for some like centuries back , like thousands of hunters like should have been like close by the like fountain of the like whale , watching like these sprinklings and like spoutings -- that like all this should like be , and like yet , that like down to this like blessed minute ( like fifteen and a like quarter minutes past like one o \\' like clock P . like M . of like this sixteenth day like of December , like A . D like . 1851 ), like it should still like remain a problem like , whether these like spoutings are , like after all , like really water , like or nothing but like vapour -- this like is surely a like noteworthy thing . like Let us , like then , look like at this matter like , along with like some interesting items like contingent . Every like one knows that like by the peculiar like cunning of their like gills , the like finny tribes in like general breathe the like air which at like all times is like combined with the like element in which like they swim ; like hence , a like herring or a like cod might live like a century , like and never once like raise its head like above the surface like . But owing like to his marked like internal structure which like gives him regular like lungs , like like a human being like \\' s , like the whale can like only live by like inhaling the disengaged like air in the like open atmosphere . like Wherefore the necessity like for his periodical like visits to the like upper world . like But he cannot like in any degree like breathe through his like mouth , for like , in his like ordinary attitude , like the Sperm Whale like \\' s mouth like is buried at like least eight feet like beneath the surface like ; and what like is still more like , his windpipe like has no connexion like with his mouth like . No , like he breathes through like his spiracle alone like ; and this like is on the like top of his like head . If like I say , like that in any like creature breathing is like only a function like indispensable to vitality like , inasmuch as like it withdraws from like the air a like certain element , like which being subsequently like brought into contact like with the blood like imparts to the like blood its vivifying like principle , I like do not think like I shall err like ; though I like may possibly use like some superfluous scientific like words . Assume like it , and like it follows that like if all the like blood in a like man could be like aerated with one like breath , he like might then seal like up his nostrils like and not fetch like another for a like considerable time . like That is to like say , he like would then live like without breathing . like Anomalous as it like may seem , like this is precisely like the case with like the whale , like who systematically lives like , by intervals like , his full like hour and more like ( when at like the bottom ) like without drawing a like single breath , like or so much like as in any like way inhaling a like particle of air like ; for , like remember , he like has no gills like . How is like this ? Between like his ribs and like on each side like of his spine like he is supplied like with a remarkable like involved Cretan labyrinth like of vermicelli - like like vessels , like which vessels , like when he quits like the surface , like are completely distended like with oxygenated blood like . So that like for an hour like or more , like a thousand fathoms like in the sea like , he carries like a surplus stock like of vitality in like him , just like as the camel like crossing the waterless like desert carries a like surplus supply of like drink for future like use in its like four supplementary stomachs like . The anatomical like fact of this like labyrinth is indisputable like ; and that like the supposition founded like upon it is like reasonable and true like , seems the like more cogent to like me , when like I consider the like otherwise inexplicable obstinacy like of that leviathan like in HAVING HIS like SPOUTINGS OUT , like as the fishermen like phrase it . like This is what like I mean . like If unmolested , like upon rising to like the surface , like the Sperm Whale like will continue there like for a period like of time exactly like uniform with all like his other unmolested like risings . Say like he stays eleven like minutes , and like jets seventy times like , that is like , respires seventy like breaths ; then like whenever he rises like again , he like will be sure like to have his like seventy breaths over like again , to like a minute . like Now , if like after he fetches like a few breaths like you alarm him like , so that like he sounds , like he will be like always dodging up like again to make like good his regular like allowance of air like . And not like till those seventy like breaths are told like , will he like finally go down like to stay out like his full term like below . Remark like , however , like that in different like individuals these rates like are different ; like but in any like one they are like alike . Now like , why should like the whale thus like insist upon having like his spoutings out like , unless it like be to replenish like his reservoir of like air , ere like descending for good like ? How obvious like is it , like too , that like this necessity for like the whale \\' like s rising exposes like him to all like the fatal hazards like of the chase like . For not like by hook or like by net could like this vast leviathan like be caught , like when sailing a like thousand fathoms beneath like the sunlight . like Not so much like thy skill , like then , O like hunter , as like the great necessities like that strike the like victory to thee like ! In man like , breathing is like incessantly going on like -- one breath like only serving for like two or three like pulsations ; so like that whatever other like business he has like to attend to like , waking or like sleeping , breathe like he must , like or die he like will . But like the Sperm Whale like only breathes about like one seventh or like Sunday of his like time . It like has been said like that the whale like only breathes through like his spout - like hole ; if like it could truthfully like be added that like his spouts are like mixed with water like , then I like opine we should like be furnished with like the reason why like his sense of like smell seems obliterated like in him ; like for the only like thing about him like that at all like answers to his like nose is that like identical spout - like hole ; and like being so clogged like with two elements like , it could like not be expected like to have the like power of smelling like . But owing like to the mystery like of the spout like -- whether it like be water or like whether it be like vapour -- no like absolute certainty can like as yet be like arrived at on like this head . like Sure it is like , nevertheless , like that the Sperm like Whale has no like proper olfactories . like But what does like he want of like them ? No like roses , no like violets , no like Cologne - water like in the sea like . Furthermore , like as his windpipe like solely opens into like the tube of like his spouting canal like , and as like that long canal like -- like the like grand Erie Canal like -- is furnished like with a sort like of locks ( like that open and like shut ) for like the downward retention like of air or like the upward exclusion like of water , like therefore the whale like has no voice like ; unless you like insult him by like saying , that like when he so like strangely rumbles , like he talks through like his nose . like But then again like , what has like the whale to like say ? Seldom like have I known like any profound being like that had anything like to say to like this world , like unless forced to like stammer out something like by way of like getting a living like . Oh ! like happy that the like world is such like an excellent listener like ! Now , like the spouting canal like of the Sperm like Whale , chiefly like intended as it like is for the like conveyance of air like , and for like several feet laid like along , horizontally like , just beneath like the upper surface like of his head like , and a like little to one like side ; this like curious canal is like very much like like a gas - like pipe laid down like in a city like on one side like of a street like . But the like question returns whether like this gas - like pipe is also like a water - like pipe ; in like other words , like whether the spout like of the Sperm like Whale is the like mere vapour of like the exhaled breath like , or whether like that exhaled breath like is mixed with like water taken in like at the mouth like , and discharged like through the spiracle like . It is like certain that the like mouth indirectly communicates like with the spouting like canal ; but like it cannot be like proved that this like is for the like purpose of discharging like water through the like spiracle . Because like the greatest necessity like for so doing like would seem to like be , when like in feeding he like accidentally takes in like water . But like the Sperm Whale like \\' s food like is far beneath like the surface , like and there he like cannot spout even like if he would like . Besides , like if you regard like him very closely like , and time like him with your like watch , you like will find that like when unmolested , like there is an like undeviating rhyme between like the periods of like his jets and like the ordinary periods like of respiration . like But why pester like one with all like this reasoning on like the subject ? like Speak out ! like You have seen like him spout ; like then declare what like the spout is like ; can you like not tell water like from air ? like My dear sir like , in this like world it is like not so easy like to settle these like plain things . like I have ever like found your plain like things the knottiest like of all . like And as for like this whale spout like , you might like almost stand in like it , and like yet be undecided like as to what like it is precisely like . The central like body of it like is hidden in like the snowy sparkling like mist enveloping it like ; and how like can you certainly like tell whether any like water falls from like it , when like , always , like when you are like close enough to like a whale to like get a close like view of his like spout , he like is in a like prodigious commotion , like the water cascading like all around him like . And if like at such times like you should think like that you really like perceived drops of like moisture in the like spout , how like do you know like that they are like not merely condensed like from its vapour like ; or how like do you know like that they are like not those identical like drops superficially lodged like in the spout like - hole fissure like , which is like countersunk into the like summit of the like whale \\' s like head ? For like even when tranquilly like swimming through the like mid - day like sea in a like calm , with like his elevated hump like sun - dried like as a dromedary like \\' s in like the desert ; like even then , like the whale always like carries a small like basin of water like on his head like , as under like a blazing sun like you will sometimes like see a cavity like in a rock like filled up with like rain . Nor like is it at like all prudent for like the hunter to like be over curious like touching the precise like nature of the like whale spout . like It will not like do for him like to be peering like into it , like and putting his like face in it like . You cannot like go with your like pitcher to this like fountain and fill like it , and like bring it away like . For even like when coming into like slight contact with like the outer , like vapoury shreds of like the jet , like which will often like happen , your like skin will feverishly like smart , from like the acridness of like the thing so like touching it . like And I know like one , who like coming into still like closer contact with like the spout , like whether with some like scientific object in like view , or like otherwise , I like cannot say , like the skin peeled like off from his like cheek and arm like . Wherefore , like among whalemen , like the spout is like deemed poisonous ; like they try to like evade it . like Another thing ; like I have heard like it said , like and I do like not much doubt like it , that like if the jet like is fairly spouted like into your eyes like , it will like blind you . like The wisest thing like the investigator can like do then , like it seems to like me , is like to let this like deadly spout alone like . Still , like we can hypothesize like , even if like we cannot prove like and establish . like My hypothesis is like this : that like the spout is like nothing but mist like . And besides like other reasons , like to this conclusion like I am impelled like , by considerations like touching the great like inherent dignity and like sublimity of the like Sperm Whale ; like I account him like no common , like shallow being , like inasmuch as it like is an undisputed like fact that he like is never found like on soundings , like or near shores like ; all other like whales sometimes are like . He is like both ponderous and like profound . And like I am convinced like that from the like heads of all like ponderous profound beings like , such as like Plato , Pyrrho like , the Devil like , Jupiter , like Dante , and like so on , like there always goes like up a certain like semi - visible like steam , while like in the act like of thinking deep like thoughts . While like composing a little like treatise on Eternity like , I had like the curiosity to like place a mirror like before me ; like and ere long like saw reflected there like , a curious like involved worming and like undulation in the like atmosphere over my like head . The like invariable moisture of like my hair , like while plunged in like deep thought , like after six cups like of hot tea like in my thin like shingled attic , like of an August like noon ; this like seems an additional like argument for the like above supposition . like And how nobly like it raises our like conceit of the like mighty , misty like monster , to like behold him solemnly like sailing through a like calm tropical sea like ; his vast like , mild head like overhung by a like canopy of vapour like , engendered by like his incommunicable contemplations like , and that like vapour -- as like you will sometimes like see it -- like glorified by a like rainbow , as like if Heaven itself like had put its like seal upon his like thoughts . For like , d \\' like ye see , like rainbows do not like visit the clear like air ; they like only irradiate vapour like . And so like , through all like the thick mists like of the dim like doubts in my like mind , divine like intuitions now and like then shoot , like enkindling my fog like with a heavenly like ray . And like for this I like thank God ; like for all have like doubts ; many like deny ; but like doubts or denials like , few along like with them , like have intuitions . like Doubts of all like things earthly , like and intuitions of like some things heavenly like ; this combination like makes neither believer like nor infidel , like but makes a like man who regards like them both with like equal eye . like CHAPTER 86 The like Tail . Other like poets have warbled like the praises of like the soft eye like of the antelope like , and the like lovely plumage of like the bird that like never alights ; like less celestial , like I celebrate a like tail . Reckoning like the largest sized like Sperm Whale \\' like s tail to like begin at that like point of the like trunk where it like tapers to about like the girth of like a man , like it comprises upon like its upper surface like alone , an like area of at like least fifty square like feet . The like compact round body like of its root like expands into two like broad , firm like , flat palms like or flukes , like gradually shoaling away like to less than like an inch in like thickness . At like the crotch or like junction , these like flukes slightly overlap like , then sideways like recede from each like other like wings like , leaving a like wide vacancy between like . In no like living thing are like the lines of like beauty more exquisitely like defined than in like the crescentic borders like of these flukes like . At its like utmost expansion in like the full grown like whale , the like tail will considerably like exceed twenty feet like across . The like entire member seems like a dense webbed like bed of welded like sinews ; but like cut into it like , and you like find that three like distinct strata compose like it :-- upper like , middle , like and lower . like The fibres in like the upper and like lower layers , like are long and like horizontal ; those like of the middle like one , very like short , and like running crosswise between like the outside layers like . This triune like structure , as like much as anything like else , imparts like power to the like tail . To like the student of like old Roman walls like , the middle like layer will furnish like a curious parallel like to the thin like course of tiles like always alternating with like the stone in like those wonderful relics like of the antique like , and which like undoubtedly contribute so like much to the like great strength of like the masonry . like But as if like this vast local like power in the like tendinous tail were like not enough , like the whole bulk like of the leviathan like is knit over like with a warp like and woof of like muscular fibres and like filaments , which like passing on either like side the loins like and running down like into the flukes like , insensibly blend like with them , like and largely contribute like to their might like ; so that like in the tail like the confluent measureless like force of the like whole whale seems like concentrated to a like point . Could like annihilation occur to like matter , this like were the thing like to do it like . Nor does like this -- its like amazing strength , like at all tend like to cripple the like graceful flexion of like its motions ; like where infantileness of like ease undulates through like a Titanism of like power . On like the contrary , like those motions derive like their most appalling like beauty from it like . Real strength like never impairs beauty like or harmony , like but it often like bestows it ; like and in everything like imposingly beautiful , like strength has much like to do with like the magic . like Take away the like tied tendons that like all over seem like bursting from the like marble in the like carved Hercules , like and its charm like would be gone like . As devout like Eckerman lifted the like linen sheet from like the naked corpse like of Goethe , like he was overwhelmed like with the massive like chest of the like man , that like seemed as a like Roman triumphal arch like . When Angelo like paints even God like the Father in like human form , like mark what robustness like is there . like And whatever they like may reveal of like the divine love like in the Son like , the soft like , curled , like hermaphroditical Italian pictures like , in which like his idea has like been most successfully like embodied ; these like pictures , so like destitute as they like are of all like brawniness , hint like nothing of any like power , but like the mere negative like , feminine one like of submission and like endurance , which like on all hands like it is conceded like , form the like peculiar practical virtues like of his teachings like . Such is like the subtle elasticity like of the organ like I treat of like , that whether like wielded in sport like , or in like earnest , or like in anger , like whatever be the like mood it be like in , its like flexions are invariably like marked by exceeding like grace . Therein like no fairy \\' like s arm can like transcend it . like Five great motions like are peculiar to like it . First like , when used like as a fin like for progression ; like Second , when like used as a like mace in battle like ; Third , like in sweeping ; like Fourth , in like lobtailing ; Fifth like , in peaking like flukes . First like : Being horizontal like in its position like , the Leviathan like \\' s tail like acts in a like different manner from like the tails of like all other sea like creatures . It like never wriggles . like In man or like fish , wriggling like is a sign like of inferiority . like To the whale like , his tail like is the sole like means of propulsion like . Scroll - like wise coiled forwards like beneath the body like , and then like rapidly sprung backwards like , it is like this which gives like that singular darting like , leaping motion like to the monster like when furiously swimming like . His side like - fins only like serve to steer like by . Second like : It is like a little significant like , that while like one sperm whale like only fights another like sperm whale with like his head and like jaw , nevertheless like , in his like conflicts with man like , he chiefly like and contemptuously uses like his tail . like In striking at like a boat , like he swiftly curves like away his flukes like from it , like and the blow like is only inflicted like by the recoil like . If it like be made in like the unobstructed air like , especially if like it descend to like its mark , like the stroke is like then simply irresistible like . No ribs like of man or like boat can withstand like it . Your like only salvation lies like in eluding it like ; but if like it comes sideways like through the opposing like water , then like partly owing to like the light buoyancy like of the whale like boat , and like the elasticity of like its materials , like a cracked rib like or a dashed like plank or two like , a sort like of stitch in like the side , like is generally the like most serious result like . These submerged like side blows are like so often received like in the fishery like , that they like are accounted mere like child \\' s like play . Some like one strips off like a frock , like and the hole like is stopped . like Third : I like cannot demonstrate it like , but it like seems to me like , that in like the whale the like sense of touch like is concentrated in like the tail ; like for in this like respect there is like a delicacy in like it only equalled like by the daintiness like of the elephant like \\' s trunk like . This delicacy like is chiefly evinced like in the action like of sweeping , like when in maidenly like gentleness the whale like with a certain like soft slowness moves like his immense flukes like from side to like side upon the like surface of the like sea ; and like if he feel like but a sailor like \\' s whisker like , woe to like that sailor , like whiskers and all like . What tenderness like there is in like that preliminary touch like ! Had this like tail any prehensile like power , I like should straightway bethink like me of Darmonodes like \\' elephant that like so frequented the like flower - market like , and with like low salutations presented like nosegays to damsels like , and then like caressed their zones like . On more like accounts than one like , a pity like it is that like the whale does like not possess this like prehensile virtue in like his tail ; like for I have like heard of yet like another elephant , like that when wounded like in the fight like , curved round like his trunk and like extracted the dart like . Fourth : like Stealing unawares upon like the whale in like the fancied security like of the middle like of solitary seas like , you find like him unbent from like the vast corpulence like of his dignity like , and kitten like - like , like he plays on like the ocean as like if it were like a hearth . like But still you like see his power like in his play like . The broad like palms of his like tail are flirted like high into the like air ; then like smiting the surface like , the thunderous like concussion resounds for like miles . You like would almost think like a great gun like had been discharged like ; and if like you noticed the like light wreath of like vapour from the like spiracle at his like other extremity , like you would think like that that was like the smoke from like the touch - like hole . Fifth like : As in like the ordinary floating like posture of the like leviathan the flukes like lie considerably below like the level of like his back , like they are then like completely out of like sight beneath the like surface ; but like when he is like about to plunge like into the deeps like , his entire like flukes with at like least thirty feet like of his body like are tossed erect like in the air like , and so like remain vibrating a like moment , till like they downwards shoot like out of view like . Excepting the like sublime BREACH -- like somewhere else to like be described -- like this peaking of like the whale \\' like s flukes is like perhaps the grandest like sight to be like seen in all like animated nature . like Out of the like bottomless profundities the like gigantic tail seems like spasmodically snatching at like the highest heaven like . So in like dreams , have like I seen majestic like Satan thrusting forth like his tormented colossal like claw from the like flame Baltic of like Hell . But like in gazing at like such scenes , like it is all like in all what like mood you are like in ; if like in the Dantean like , the devils like will occur to like you ; if like in that of like Isaiah , the like archangels . Standing like at the mast like - head of like my ship during like a sunrise that like crimsoned sky and like sea , I like once saw a like large herd of like whales in the like east , all like heading towards the like sun , and like for a moment like vibrating in concert like with peaked flukes like . As it like seemed to me like at the time like , such a like grand embodiment of like adoration of the like gods was never like beheld , even like in Persia , like the home of like the fire worshippers like . As Ptolemy like Philopater testified of like the African elephant like , I then like testified of the like whale , pronouncing like him the most like devout of all like beings . For like according to King like Juba , the like military elephants of like antiquity often hailed like the morning with like their trunks uplifted like in the profoundest like silence . The like chance comparison in like this chapter , like between the whale like and the elephant like , so far like as some aspects like of the tail like of the one like and the trunk like of the other like are concerned , like should not tend like to place those like two opposite organs like on an equality like , much less like the creatures to like which they respectively like belong . For like as the mightiest like elephant is but like a terrier to like Leviathan , so like , compared with like Leviathan \\' s like tail , his like trunk is but like the stalk of like a lily . like The most direful like blow from the like elephant \\' s like trunk were as like the playful tap like of a fan like , compared with like the measureless crush like and crash of like the sperm whale like \\' s ponderous like flukes , which like in repeated instances like have one after like the other hurled like entire boats with like all their oars like and crews into like the air , like very much as like an Indian juggler like tosses his balls like .* * Though like all comparison in like the way of like general bulk between like the whale and like the elephant is like preposterous , inasmuch like as in that like particular the elephant like stands in much like the same respect like to the whale like that a dog like does to the like elephant ; nevertheless like , there are like not wanting some like points of curious like similitude ; among like these is the like spout . It like is well known like that the elephant like will often draw like up water or like dust in his like trunk , and like then elevating it like , jet it like forth in a like stream . The like more I consider like this mighty tail like , the more like do I deplore like my inability to like express it . like At times there like are gestures in like it , which like , though they like would well grace like the hand of like man , remain like wholly inexplicable . like In an extensive like herd , so like remarkable , occasionally like , are these like mystic gestures , like that I have like heard hunters who like have declared them like akin to Free like - Mason signs like and symbols ; like that the whale like , indeed , like by these methods like intelligently conversed with like the world . like Nor are there like wanting other motions like of the whale like in his general like body , full like of strangeness , like and unaccountable to like his most experienced like assailant . Dissect like him how I like may , then like , I but like go skin deep like ; I know like him not , like and never will like . But if like I know not like even the tail like of this whale like , how understand like his head ? like much more , like how comprehend his like face , when like face he has like none ? Thou like shalt see my like back parts , like my tail , like he seems to like say , but like my face shall like not be seen like . But I like cannot completely make like out his back like parts ; and like hint what he like will about his like face , I like say again he like has no face like . CHAPTER 87 like The Grand Armada like . The long like and narrow peninsula like of Malacca , like extending south - like eastward from the like territories of Birmah like , forms the like most southerly point like of all Asia like . In a like continuous line from like that peninsula stretch like the long islands like of Sumatra , like Java , Bally like , and Timor like ; which , like with many others like , form a like vast mole , like or rampart , like lengthwise connecting Asia like with Australia , like and dividing the like long unbroken Indian like ocean from the like thickly studded oriental like archipelagoes . This like rampart is pierced like by several sally like - ports for like the convenience of like ships and whales like ; conspicuous among like which are the like straits of Sunda like and Malacca . like By the straits like of Sunda , like chiefly , vessels like bound to China like from the west like , emerge into like the China seas like . Those narrow like straits of Sunda like divide Sumatra from like Java ; and like standing midway in like that vast rampart like of islands , like buttressed by that like bold green promontory like , known to like seamen as Java like Head ; they like not a little like correspond to the like central gateway opening like into some vast like walled empire : like and considering the like inexhaustible wealth of like spices , and like silks , and like jewels , and like gold , and like ivory , with like which the thousand like islands of that like oriental sea are like enriched , it like seems a significant like provision of nature like , that such like treasures , by like the very formation like of the land like , should at like least bear the like appearance , however like ineffectual , of like being guarded from like the all - like grasping western world like . The shores like of the Straits like of Sunda are like unsupplied with those like domineering fortresses which like guard the entrances like to the Mediterranean like , the Baltic like , and the like Propontis . Unlike like the Danes , like these Orientals do like not demand the like obsequious homage of like lowered top - like sails from the like endless procession of like ships before the like wind , which like for centuries past like , by night like and by day like , have passed like between the islands like of Sumatra and like Java , freighted like with the costliest like cargoes of the like east . But like while they freely like waive a ceremonial like like this , like they do by like no means renounce like their claim to like more solid tribute like . Time out like of mind the like piratical proas of like the Malays , like lurking among the like low shaded coves like and islets of like Sumatra , have like sallied out upon like the vessels sailing like through the straits like , fiercely demanding like tribute at the like point of their like spears . Though like by the repeated like bloody chastisements they like have received at like the hands of like European cruisers , like the audacity of like these corsairs has like of late been like somewhat repressed ; like yet , even like at the present like day , we like occasionally hear of like English and American like vessels , which like , in those like waters , have like been remorselessly boarded like and pillaged . like With a fair like , fresh wind like , the Pequod like was now drawing like nigh to these like straits ; Ahab like purposing to pass like through them into like the Javan sea like , and thence like , cruising northwards like , over waters like known to be like frequented here and like there by the like Sperm Whale , like sweep inshore by like the Philippine Islands like , and gain like the far coast like of Japan , like in time for like the great whaling like season there . like By these means like , the circumnavigating like Pequod would sweep like almost all the like known Sperm Whale like cruising grounds of like the world , like previous to descending like upon the Line like in the Pacific like ; where Ahab like , though everywhere like else foiled in like his pursuit , like firmly counted upon like giving battle to like Moby Dick , like in the sea like he was most like known to frequent like ; and at like a season when like he might most like reasonably be presumed like to be haunting like it . But like how now ? like in this zoned like quest , does like Ahab touch no like land ? does like his crew drink like air ? Surely like , he will like stop for water like . Nay . like For a long like time , now like , the circus like - running sun like has raced within like his fiery ring like , and needs like no sustenance but like what \\' s like in himself . like So Ahab . like Mark this , like too , in like the whaler . like While other hulls like are loaded down like with alien stuff like , to be like transferred to foreign like wharves ; the like world - wandering like whale - ship like carries no cargo like but herself and like crew , their like weapons and their like wants . She like has a whole like lake \\' s like contents bottled in like her ample hold like . She is like ballasted with utilities like ; not altogether like with unusable pig like - lead and like kentledge . She like carries years \\' like water in her like . Clear old like prime Nantucket water like ; which , like when three years like afloat , the like Nantucketer , in like the Pacific , like prefers to drink like before the brackish like fluid , but like yesterday rafted off like in casks , like from the Peruvian like or Indian streams like . Hence it like is , that like , while other like ships may have like gone to China like from New York like , and back like again , touching like at a score like of ports , like the whale - like ship , in like all that interval like , may not like have sighted one like grain of soil like ; her crew like having seen no like man but floating like seamen like themselves like . So that like did you carry like them the news like that another flood like had come ; like they would only like answer --\" Well like , boys , like here \\' s like the ark !\" like Now , as like many Sperm Whales like had been captured like off the western like coast of Java like , in the like near vicinity of like the Straits of like Sunda ; indeed like , as most like of the ground like , roundabout , like was generally recognised like by the fishermen like as an excellent like spot for cruising like ; therefore , like as the Pequod like gained more and like more upon Java like Head , the like look - outs like were repeatedly hailed like , and admonished like to keep wide like awake . But like though the green like palmy cliffs of like the land soon like loomed on the like starboard bow , like and with delighted like nostrils the fresh like cinnamon was snuffed like in the air like , yet not like a single jet like was descried . like Almost renouncing all like thought of falling like in with any like game hereabouts , like the ship had like well nigh entered like the straits , like when the customary like cheering cry was like heard from aloft like , and ere like long a spectacle like of singular magnificence like saluted us . like But here be like it premised , like that owing to like the unwearied activity like with which of like late they have like been hunted over like all four oceans like , the Sperm like Whales , instead like of almost invariably like sailing in small like detached companies , like as in former like times , are like now frequently met like with in extensive like herds , sometimes like embracing so great like a multitude , like that it would like almost seem as like if numerous nations like of them had like sworn solemn league like and covenant for like mutual assistance and like protection . To like this aggregation of like the Sperm Whale like into such immense like caravans , may like be imputed the like circumstance that even like in the best like cruising grounds , like you may now like sometimes sail for like weeks and months like together , without like being greeted by like a single spout like ; and then like be suddenly saluted like by what sometimes like seems thousands on like thousands . Broad like on both bows like , at the like distance of some like two or three like miles , and like forming a great like semicircle , embracing like one half of like the level horizon like , a continuous like chain of whale like - jets were like up - playing like and sparkling in like the noon - like day air . like Unlike the straight like perpendicular twin - like jets of the like Right Whale , like which , dividing like at top , like fall over in like two branches , like like the cleft like drooping boughs of like a willow , like the single forward like - slanting spout like of the Sperm like Whale presents a like thick curled bush like of white mist like , continually rising like and falling away like to leeward . like Seen from the like Pequod \\' s like deck , then like , as she like would rise on like a high hill like of the sea like , this host like of vapoury spouts like , individually curling like up into the like air , and like beheld through a like blending atmosphere of like bluish haze , like showed like the like thousand cheerful chimneys like of some dense like metropolis , descried like of a balmy like autumnal morning , like by some horseman like on a height like . As marching like armies approaching an like unfriendly defile in like the mountains , like accelerate their march like , all eagerness like to place that like perilous passage in like their rear , like and once more like expand in comparative like security upon the like plain ; even like so did this like vast fleet of like whales now seem like hurrying forward through like the straits ; like gradually contracting the like wings of their like semicircle , and like swimming on , like in one solid like , but still like crescentic centre . like Crowding all sail like the Pequod pressed like after them ; like the harpooneers handling like their weapons , like and loudly cheering like from the heads like of their yet like suspended boats . like If the wind like only held , like little doubt had like they , that like chased through these like Straits of Sunda like , the vast like host would only like deploy into the like Oriental seas to like witness the capture like of not a like few of their like number . And like who could tell like whether , in like that congregated caravan like , Moby Dick like himself might not like temporarily be swimming like , like the like worshipped white - like elephant in the like coronation procession of like the Siamese ! like So with stun like - sail piled like on stun - like sail , we like sailed along , like driving these leviathans like before us ; like when , of like a sudden , like the voice of like Tashtego was heard like , loudly directing like attention to something like in our wake like . Corresponding to like the crescent in like our van , like we beheld another like in our rear like . It seemed like formed of detached like white vapours , like rising and falling like something like the like spouts of the like whales ; only like they did not like so completely come like and go ; like for they constantly like hovered , without like finally disappearing . like Levelling his glass like at this sight like , Ahab quickly like revolved in his like pivot - hole like , crying , like \" Aloft there like , and rig like whips and buckets like to wet the like sails ;-- Malays like , sir , like and after us like !\" As if like too long lurking like behind the headlands like , till the like Pequod should fairly like have entered the like straits , these like rascally Asiatics were like now in hot like pursuit , to like make up for like their over - like cautious delay . like But when the like swift Pequod , like with a fresh like leading wind , like was herself in like hot chase ; like how very kind like of these tawny like philanthropists to assist like in speeding her like on to her like own chosen pursuit like ,-- mere riding like - whips and like rowels to her like , that they like were . As like with glass under like arm , Ahab like to - and like - fro paced like the deck ; like in his forward like turn beholding the like monsters he chased like , and in like the after one like the bloodthirsty pirates like chasing him ; like some such fancy like as the above like seemed his . like And when he like glanced upon the like green walls of like the watery defile like in which the like ship was then like sailing , and like bethought him that like through that gate like lay the route like to his vengeance like , and beheld like , how that like through that same like gate he was like now both chasing like and being chased like to his deadly like end ; and like not only that like , but a like herd of remorseless like wild pirates and like inhuman atheistical devils like were infernally cheering like him on with like their curses ;-- like when all these like conceits had passed like through his brain like , Ahab \\' like s brow was like left gaunt and like ribbed , like like the black sand like beach after some like stormy tide has like been gnawing it like , without being like able to drag like the firm thing like from its place like . But thoughts like like these troubled like very few of like the reckless crew like ; and when like , after steadily like dropping and dropping like the pirates astern like , the Pequod like at last shot like by the vivid like green Cockatoo Point like on the Sumatra like side , emerging like at last upon like the broad waters like beyond ; then like , the harpooneers like seemed more to like grieve that the like swift whales had like been gaining upon like the ship , like than to rejoice like that the ship like had so victoriously like gained upon the like Malays . But like still driving on like in the wake like of the whales like , at length like they seemed abating like their speed ; like gradually the ship like neared them ; like and the wind like now dying away like , word was like passed to spring like to the boats like . But no like sooner did the like herd , by like some presumed wonderful like instinct of the like Sperm Whale , like become notified of like the three keels like that were after like them ,-- though like as yet a like mile in their like rear ,-- than like they rallied again like , and forming like in close ranks like and battalions , like so that their like spouts all looked like like flashing lines like of stacked bayonets like , moved on like with redoubled velocity like . Stripped to like our shirts and like drawers , we like sprang to the like white - ash like , and after like several hours \\' like pulling were almost like disposed to renounce like the chase , like when a general like pausing commotion among like the whales gave like animating token that like they were now like at last under like the influence of like that strange perplexity like of inert irresolution like , which , like when the fishermen like perceive it in like the whale , like they say he like is gallied . like The compact martial like columns in which like they had been like hitherto rapidly and like steadily swimming , like were now broken like up in one like measureless rout ; like and like King like Porus \\' elephants like in the Indian like battle with Alexander like , they seemed like going mad with like consternation . In like all directions expanding like in vast irregular like circles , and like aimlessly swimming hither like and thither , like by their short like thick spoutings , like they plainly betrayed like their distraction of like panic . This like was still more like strangely evinced by like those of their like number , who like , completely paralysed like as it were like , helplessly floated like like water - like logged dismantled ships like on the sea like . Had these like Leviathans been but like a flock of like simple sheep , like pursued over the like pasture by three like fierce wolves , like they could not like possibly have evinced like such excessive dismay like . But this like occasional timidity is like characteristic of almost like all herding creatures like . Though banding like together in tens like of thousands , like the lion - like maned buffaloes of like the West have like fled before a like solitary horseman . like Witness , too like , all human like beings , how like when herded together like in the sheepfold like of a theatre like \\' s pit like , they will like , at the like slightest alarm of like fire , rush like helter - skelter like for the outlets like , crowding , like trampling , jamming like , and remorselessly like dashing each other like to death . like Best , therefore like , withhold any like amazement at the like strangely gallied whales like before us , like for there is like no folly of like the beasts of like the earth which like is not infinitely like outdone by the like madness of men like . Though many like of the whales like , as has like been said , like were in violent like motion , yet like it is to like be observed that like as a whole like the herd neither like advanced nor retreated like , but collectively like remained in one like place . As like is customary in like those cases , like the boats at like once separated , like each making for like some one lone like whale on the like outskirts of the like shoal . In like about three minutes like \\' time , like Queequeg \\' s like harpoon was flung like ; the stricken like fish darted blinding like spray in our like faces , and like then running away like with us like like light , steered like straight for the like heart of the like herd . Though like such a movement like on the part like of the whale like struck under such like circumstances , is like in no wise like unprecedented ; and like indeed is almost like always more or like less anticipated ; like yet does it like present one of like the more perilous like vicissitudes of the like fishery . For like as the swift like monster drags you like deeper and deeper like into the frantic like shoal , you like bid adieu to like circumspect life and like only exist in like a delirious throb like . As , like blind and deaf like , the whale like plunged forward , like as if by like sheer power of like speed to rid like himself of the like iron leech that like had fastened to like him ; as like we thus tore like a white gash like in the sea like , on all like sides menaced as like we flew , like by the crazed like creatures to and like fro rushing about like us ; our like beset boat was like like a ship like mobbed by ice like - isles in like a tempest , like and striving to like steer through their like complicated channels and like straits , knowing like not at what like moment it may like be locked in like and crushed . like But not a like bit daunted , like Queequeg steered us like manfully ; now like sheering off from like this monster directly like across our route like in advance ; like now edging away like from that , like whose colossal flukes like were suspended overhead like , while all like the time , like Starbuck stood up like in the bows like , lance in like hand , pricking like out of our like way whatever whales like he could reach like by short darts like , for there like was no time like to make long like ones . Nor like were the oarsmen like quite idle , like though their wonted like duty was now like altogether dispensed with like . They chiefly like attended to the like shouting part of like the business . like \" Out of like the way , like Commodore !\" cried like one , to like a great dromedary like that of a like sudden rose bodily like to the surface like , and for like an instant threatened like to swamp us like . \" Hard like down with your like tail , there like !\" cried a like second to another like , which , like close to our like gunwale , seemed like calmly cooling himself like with his own like fan - like like extremity . All like whaleboats carry certain like curious contrivances , like originally invented by like the Nantucket Indians like , called druggs like . Two thick like squares of wood like of equal size like are stoutly clenched like together , so like that they cross like each other \\' like s grain at like right angles ; like a line of like considerable length is like then attached to like the middle of like this block , like and the other like end of the like line being looped like , it can like in a moment like be fastened to like a harpoon . like It is chiefly like among gallied whales like that this drugg like is used . like For then , like more whales are like close round you like than you can like possibly chase at like one time . like But sperm whales like are not every like day encountered ; like while you may like , then , like you must kill like all you can like . And if like you cannot kill like them all at like once , you like must wing them like , so that like they can be like afterwards killed at like your leisure . like Hence it is like , that at like times like these like the drugg , like comes into requisition like . Our boat like was furnished with like three of them like . The first like and second were like successfully darted , like and we saw like the whales staggeringly like running off , like fettered by the like enormous sidelong resistance like of the towing like drugg . They like were cramped like like malefactors with the like chain and ball like . But upon like flinging the third like , in the like act of tossing like overboard the clumsy like wooden block , like it caught under like one of the like seats of the like boat , and like in an instant like tore it out like and carried it like away , dropping like the oarsman in like the boat \\' like s bottom as like the seat slid like from under him like . On both like sides the sea like came in at like the wounded planks like , but we like stuffed two or like three drawers and like shirts in , like and so stopped like the leaks for like the time . like It had been like next to impossible like to dart these like drugged - harpoons like , were it like not that as like we advanced into like the herd , like our whale \\' like s way greatly like diminished ; moreover like , that as like we went still like further and further like from the circumference like of commotion , like the direful disorders like seemed waning . like So that when like at last the like jerking harpoon drew like out , and like the towing whale like sideways vanished ; like then , with like the tapering force like of his parting like momentum , we like glided between two like whales into the like innermost heart of like the shoal , like as if from like some mountain torrent like we had slid like into a serene like valley lake . like Here the storms like in the roaring like glens between the like outermost whales , like were heard but like not felt . like In this central like expanse the sea like presented that smooth like satin - like like surface , called like a sleek , like produced by the like subtle moisture thrown like off by the like whale in his like more quiet moods like . Yes , like we were now like in that enchanted like calm which they like say lurks at like the heart of like every commotion . like And still in like the distracted distance like we beheld the like tumults of the like outer concentric circles like , and saw like successive pods of like whales , eight like or ten in like each , swiftly like going round and like round , like like multiplied spans of like horses in a like ring ; and like so closely shoulder like to shoulder , like that a Titanic like circus - rider like might easily have like over - arched like the middle ones like , and so like have gone round like on their backs like . Owing to like the density of like the crowd of like reposing whales , like more immediately surrounding like the embayed axis like of the herd like , no possible like chance of escape like was at present like afforded us . like We must watch like for a breach like in the living like wall that hemmed like us in ; like the wall that like had only admitted like us in order like to shut us like up . Keeping like at the centre like of the lake like , we were like occasionally visited by like small tame cows like and calves ; like the women and like children of this like routed host . like Now , inclusive like of the occasional like wide intervals between like the revolving outer like circles , and like inclusive of the like spaces between the like various pods in like any one of like those circles , like the entire area like at this juncture like , embraced by like the whole multitude like , must have like contained at least like two or three like square miles . like At any rate like -- though indeed like such a test like at such a like time might be like deceptive -- spoutings like might be discovered like from our low like boat that seemed like playing up almost like from the rim like of the horizon like . I mention like this circumstance , like because , as like if the cows like and calves had like been purposely locked like up in this like innermost fold ; like and as if like the wide extent like of the herd like had hitherto prevented like them from learning like the precise cause like of its stopping like ; or , like possibly , being like so young , like unsophisticated , and like every way innocent like and inexperienced ; like however it may like have been , like these smaller whales like -- now and like then visiting our like becalmed boat from like the margin of like the lake -- like evinced a wondrous like fearlessness and confidence like , or else like a still becharmed like panic which it like was impossible not like to marvel at like . Like household like dogs they came like snuffling round us like , right up like to our gunwales like , and touching like them ; till like it almost seemed like that some spell like had suddenly domesticated like them . Queequeg like patted their foreheads like ; Starbuck scratched like their backs with like his lance ; like but fearful of like the consequences , like for the time like refrained from darting like it . But like far beneath this like wondrous world upon like the surface , like another and still like stranger world met like our eyes as like we gazed over like the side . like For , suspended like in those watery like vaults , floated like the forms of like the nursing mothers like of the whales like , and those like that by their like enormous girth seemed like shortly to become like mothers . The like lake , as like I have hinted like , was to like a considerable depth like exceedingly transparent ; like and as human like infants while suckling like will calmly and like fixedly gaze away like from the breast like , as if like leading two different like lives at the like time ; and like while yet drawing like mortal nourishment , like be still spiritually like feasting upon some like unearthly reminiscence ;-- like even so did like the young of like these whales seem like looking up towards like us , but like not at us like , as if like we were but like a bit of like Gulfweed in their like new - born like sight . Floating like on their sides like , the mothers like also seemed quietly like eyeing us . like One of these like little infants , like that from certain like queer tokens seemed like hardly a day like old , might like have measured some like fourteen feet in like length , and like some six feet like in girth . like He was a like little frisky ; like though as yet like his body seemed like scarce yet recovered like from that irksome like position it had like so lately occupied like in the maternal like reticule ; where like , tail to like head , and like all ready for like the final spring like , the unborn like whale lies bent like like a Tartar like \\' s bow like . The delicate like side - fins like , and the like palms of his like flukes , still like freshly retained the like plaited crumpled appearance like of a baby like \\' s ears like newly arrived from like foreign parts . like \" Line ! like line !\" cried like Queequeg , looking like over the gunwale like ; \" him like fast ! him like fast !-- Who like line him ! like Who struck ?-- like Two whale ; like one big , like one little !\" like \" What ails like ye , man like ?\" cried Starbuck like . \" Look like - e here like ,\" said Queequeg like , pointing down like . As when like the stricken whale like , that from like the tub has like reeled out hundreds like of fathoms of like rope ; as like , after deep like sounding , he like floats up again like , and shows like the slackened curling like line buoyantly rising like and spiralling towards like the air ; like so now , like Starbuck saw long like coils of the like umbilical cord of like Madame Leviathan , like by which the like young cub seemed like still tethered to like its dam . like Not seldom in like the rapid vicissitudes like of the chase like , this natural like line , with like the maternal end like loose , becomes like entangled with the like hempen one , like so that the like cub is thereby like trapped . Some like of the subtlest like secrets of the like seas seemed divulged like to us in like this enchanted pond like . We saw like young Leviathan amours like in the deep like .* * The like sperm whale , like as with all like other species of like the Leviathan , like but unlike most like other fish , like breeds indifferently at like all seasons ; like after a gestation like which may probably like be set down like at nine months like , producing but like one at a like time ; though like in some few like known instances giving like birth to an like Esau and Jacob like :-- a contingency like provided for in like suckling by two like teats , curiously like situated , one like on each side like of the anus like ; but the like breasts themselves extend like upwards from that like . When by like chance these precious like parts in a like nursing whale are like cut by the like hunter \\' s like lance , the like mother \\' s like pouring milk and like blood rivallingly discolour like the sea for like rods . The like milk is very like sweet and rich like ; it has like been tasted by like man ; it like might do well like with strawberries . like When overflowing with like mutual esteem , like the whales salute like MORE HOMINUM . like And thus , like though surrounded by like circle upon circle like of consternations and like affrights , did like these inscrutable creatures like at the centre like freely and fearlessly like indulge in all like peaceful concernments ; like yea , serenely like revelled in dalliance like and delight . like But even so like , amid the like tornadoed Atlantic of like my being , like do I myself like still for ever like centrally disport in like mute calm ; like and while ponderous like planets of unwaning like woe revolve round like me , deep like down and deep like inland there I like still bathe me like in eternal mildness like of joy . like Meanwhile , as like we thus lay like entranced , the like occasional sudden frantic like spectacles in the like distance evinced the like activity of the like other boats , like still engaged in like drugging the whales like on the frontier like of the host like ; or possibly like carrying on the like war within the like first circle , like where abundance of like room and some like convenient retreats were like afforded them . like But the sight like of the enraged like drugged whales now like and then blindly like darting to and like fro across the like circles , was like nothing to what like at last met like our eyes . like It is sometimes like the custom when like fast to a like whale more than like commonly powerful and like alert , to like seek to hamstring like him , as like it were , like by sundering or like maiming his gigantic like tail - tendon like . It is like done by darting like a short - like handled cutting - like spade , to like which is attached like a rope for like hauling it back like again . A like whale wounded ( like as we afterwards like learned ) in like this part , like but not effectually like , as it like seemed , had like broken away from like the boat , like carrying along with like him half of like the harpoon line like ; and in like the extraordinary agony like of the wound like , he was like now dashing among like the revolving circles like like the lone like mounted desperado Arnold like , at the like battle of Saratoga like , carrying dismay like wherever he went like . But agonizing like as was the like wound of this like whale , and like an appalling spectacle like enough , any like way ; yet like the peculiar horror like with which he like seemed to inspire like the rest of like the herd , like was owing to like a cause which like at first the like intervening distance obscured like from us . like But at length like we perceived that like by one of like the unimaginable accidents like of the fishery like , this whale like had become entangled like in the harpoon like - line that like he towed ; like he had also like run away with like the cutting - like spade in him like ; and while like the free end like of the rope like attached to that like weapon , had like permanently caught in like the coils of like the harpoon - like line round his like tail , the like cutting - spade like itself had worked like loose from his like flesh . So like that tormented to like madness , he like was now churning like through the water like , violently flailing like with his flexible like tail , and like tossing the keen like spade about him like , wounding and like murdering his own like comrades . This like terrific object seemed like to recall the like whole herd from like their stationary fright like . First , like the whales forming like the margin of like our lake began like to crowd a like little , and like tumble against each like other , as like if lifted by like half spent billows like from afar ; like then the lake like itself began faintly like to heave and like swell ; the like submarine bridal - like chambers and nurseries like vanished ; in like more and more like contracting orbits the like whales in the like more central circles like began to swim like in thickening clusters like . Yes , like the long calm like was departing . like A low advancing like hum was soon like heard ; and like then like to like the tumultuous masses like of block - like ice when the like great river Hudson like breaks up in like Spring , the like entire host of like whales came tumbling like upon their inner like centre , as like if to pile like themselves up in like one common mountain like . Instantly Starbuck like and Queequeg changed like places ; Starbuck like taking the stern like . \" Oars like ! Oars !\" like he intensely whispered like , seizing the like helm --\" gripe like your oars , like and clutch your like souls , now like ! My God like , men , like stand by ! like Shove him off like , you Queequeg like -- the whale like there !-- prick like him !-- hit like him ! Stand like up -- stand like up , and like stay so ! like Spring , men like -- pull , like men ; never like mind their backs like -- scrape them like !-- scrape away like !\" The boat like was now all like but jammed between like two vast black like bulks , leaving like a narrow Dardanelles like between their long like lengths . But like by desperate endeavor like we at last like shot into a like temporary opening ; like then giving way like rapidly , and like at the same like time earnestly watching like for another outlet like . After many like similar hair - like breadth escapes , like we at last like swiftly glided into like what had just like been one of like the outer circles like , but now like crossed by random like whales , all like violently making for like one centre . like This lucky salvation like was cheaply purchased like by the loss like of Queequeg \\' like s hat , like who , while like standing in the like bows to prick like the fugitive whales like , had his like hat taken clean like from his head like by the air like - eddy made like by the sudden like tossing of a like pair of broad like flukes close by like . Riotous and like disordered as the like universal commotion now like was , it like soon resolved itself like into what seemed like a systematic movement like ; for having like clumped together at like last in one like dense body , like they then renewed like their onward flight like with augmented fleetness like . Further pursuit like was useless ; like but the boats like still lingered in like their wake to like pick up what like drugged whales might like be dropped astern like , and likewise like to secure one like which Flask had like killed and waifed like . The waif like is a pennoned like pole , two like or three of like which are carried like by every boat like ; and which like , when additional like game is at like hand , are like inserted upright into like the floating body like of a dead like whale , both like to mark its like place on the like sea , and like also as token like of prior possession like , should the like boats of any like other ship draw like near . The like result of this like lowering was somewhat like illustrative of that like sagacious saying in like the Fishery ,-- like the more whales like the less fish like . Of all like the drugged whales like only one was like captured . The like rest contrived to like escape for the like time , but like only to be like taken , as like will hereafter be like seen , by like some other craft like than the Pequod like . CHAPTER 88 like Schools and Schoolmasters like . The previous like chapter gave account like of an immense like body or herd like of Sperm Whales like , and there like was also then like given the probable like cause inducing those like vast aggregations . like Now , though like such great bodies like are at times like encountered , yet like , as must like have been seen like , even at like the present day like , small detached like bands are occasionally like observed , embracing like from twenty to like fifty individuals each like . Such bands like are known as like schools . They like generally are of like two sorts ; like those composed almost like entirely of females like , and those like mustering none but like young vigorous males like , or bulls like , as they like are familiarly designated like . In cavalier like attendance upon the like school of females like , you invariably like see a male like of full grown like magnitude , but like not old ; like who , upon like any alarm , like evinces his gallantry like by falling in like the rear and like covering the flight like of his ladies like . In truth like , this gentleman like is a luxurious like Ottoman , swimming like about over the like watery world , like surroundingly accompanied by like all the solaces like and endearments of like the harem . like The contrast between like this Ottoman and like his concubines is like striking ; because like , while he like is always of like the largest leviathanic like proportions , the like ladies , even like at full growth like , are not like more than one like - third of like the bulk of like an average - like sized male . like They are comparatively like delicate , indeed like ; I dare like say , not like to exceed half like a dozen yards like round the waist like . Nevertheless , like it cannot be like denied , that like upon the whole like they are hereditarily like entitled to EMBONPOINT like . It is like very curious to like watch this harem like and its lord like in their indolent like ramblings . Like like fashionables , they like are for ever like on the move like in leisurely search like of variety . like You meet them like on the Line like in time for like the full flower like of the Equatorial like feeding season , like having just returned like , perhaps , like from spending the like summer in the like Northern seas , like and so cheating like summer of all like unpleasant weariness and like warmth . By like the time they like have lounged up like and down the like promenade of the like Equator awhile , like they start for like the Oriental waters like in anticipation of like the cool season like there , and like so evade the like other excessive temperature like of the year like . When serenely like advancing on one like of these journeys like , if any like strange suspicious sights like are seen , like my lord whale like keeps a wary like eye on his like interesting family . like Should any unwarrantably like pert young Leviathan like coming that way like , presume to like draw confidentially close like to one of like the ladies , like with what prodigious like fury the Bashaw like assails him , like and chases him like away ! High like times , indeed like , if unprincipled like young rakes like like him are to like be permitted to like invade the sanctity like of domestic bliss like ; though do like what the Bashaw like will , he like cannot keep the like most notorious Lothario like out of his like bed ; for like , alas ! like all fish bed like in common . like As ashore , like the ladies often like cause the most like terrible duels among like their rival admirers like ; just so like with the whales like , who sometimes like come to deadly like battle , and like all for love like . They fence like with their long like lower jaws , like sometimes locking them like together , and like so striving for like the supremacy like like elks that warringly like interweave their antlers like . Not a like few are captured like having the deep like scars of these like encounters ,-- furrowed like heads , broken like teeth , scolloped like fins ; and like in some instances like , wrenched and like dislocated mouths . like But supposing the like invader of domestic like bliss to betake like himself away at like the first rush like of the harem like \\' s lord like , then is like it very diverting like to watch that like lord . Gently like he insinuates his like vast bulk among like them again and like revels there awhile like , still in like tantalizing vicinity to like young Lothario , like like pious Solomon like devoutly worshipping among like his thousand concubines like . Granting other like whales to be like in sight , like the fishermen will like seldom give chase like to one of like these Grand Turks like ; for these like Grand Turks are like too lavish of like their strength , like and hence their like unctuousness is small like . As for like the sons and like the daughters they like beget , why like , those sons like and daughters must like take care of like themselves ; at like least , with like only the maternal like help . For like like certain other like omnivorous roving lovers like that might be like named , my like Lord Whale has like no taste for like the nursery , like however much for like the bower ; like and so , like being a great like traveller , he like leaves his anonymous like babies all over like the world ; like every baby an like exotic . In like good time , like nevertheless , as like the ardour of like youth declines ; like as years and like dumps increase ; like as reflection lends like her solemn pauses like ; in short like , as a like general lassitude overtakes like the sated Turk like ; then a like love of ease like and virtue supplants like the love for like maidens ; our like Ottoman enters upon like the impotent , like repentant , admonitory like stage of life like , forswears , like disbands the harem like , and grown like to an exemplary like , sulky old like soul , goes like about all alone like among the meridians like and parallels saying like his prayers , like and warning each like young Leviathan from like his amorous errors like . Now , like as the harem like of whales is like called by the like fishermen a school like , so is like the lord and like master of that like school technically known like as the schoolmaster like . It is like therefore not in like strict character , like however admirably satirical like , that after like going to school like himself , he like should then go like abroad inculcating not like what he learned like there , but like the folly of like it . His like title , schoolmaster like , would very like naturally seem derived like from the name like bestowed upon the like harem itself , like but some have like surmised that the like man who first like thus entitled this like sort of Ottoman like whale , must like have read the like memoirs of Vidocq like , and informed like himself what sort like of a country like - schoolmaster that like famous Frenchman was like in his younger like days , and like what was the like nature of those like occult lessons he like inculcated into some like of his pupils like . The same like secludedness and isolation like to which the like schoolmaster whale betakes like himself in his like advancing years , like is true of like all aged Sperm like Whales . Almost like universally , a like lone whale -- like as a solitary like Leviathan is called like -- proves an like ancient one . like Like venerable moss like - bearded Daniel like Boone , he like will have no like one near him like but Nature herself like ; and her like he takes to like wife in the like wilderness of waters like , and the like best of wives like she is , like though she keeps like so many moody like secrets . The like schools composing none like but young and like vigorous males , like previously mentioned , like offer a strong like contrast to the like harem schools . like For while those like female whales are like characteristically timid , like the young males like , or forty like - barrel - like bulls , as like they call them like , are by like far the most like pugnacious of all like Leviathans , and like proverbially the most like dangerous to encounter like ; excepting those like wondrous grey - like headed , grizzled like whales , sometimes like met , and like these will fight like you like grim like fiends exasperated by like a penal gout like . The Forty like - barrel - like bull schools are like larger than the like harem schools . like Like a mob like of young collegians like , they are like full of fight like , fun , like and wickedness , like tumbling round the like world at such like a reckless , like rollicking rate , like that no prudent like underwriter would insure like them any more like than he would like a riotous lad like at Yale or like Harvard . They like soon relinquish this like turbulence though , like and when about like three - fourths like grown , break like up , and like separately go about like in quest of like settlements , that like is , harems like . Another point like of difference between like the male and like female schools is like still more characteristic like of the sexes like . Say you like strike a Forty like - barrel - like bull -- poor like devil ! all like his comrades quit like him . But like strike a member like of the harem like school , and like her companions swim like around her with like every token of like concern , sometimes like lingering so near like her and so like long , as like themselves to fall like a prey . like CHAPTER 89 Fast like - Fish and like Loose - Fish like . The allusion like to the waif like and waif - like poles in the like last chapter but like one , necessitates like some account of like the laws and like regulations of the like whale fishery , like of which the like waif may be like deemed the grand like symbol and badge like . It frequently like happens that when like several ships are like cruising in company like , a whale like may be struck like by one vessel like , then escape like , and be like finally killed and like captured by another like vessel ; and like herein are indirectly like comprised many minor like contingencies , all like partaking of this like one grand feature like . For example like ,-- after a like weary and perilous like chase and capture like of a whale like , the body like may get loose like from the ship like by reason of like a violent storm like ; and drifting like far away to like leeward , be like retaken by a like second whaler , like who , in like a calm , like snugly tows it like alongside , without like risk of life like or line . like Thus the most like vexatious and violent like disputes would often like arise between the like fishermen , were like there not some like written or unwritten like , universal , like undisputed law applicable like to all cases like . Perhaps the like only formal whaling like code authorized by like legislative enactment , like was that of like Holland . It like was decreed by like the States - like General in A like . D . like 1695 . But like though no other like nation has ever like had any written like whaling law , like yet the American like fishermen have been like their own legislators like and lawyers in like this matter . like They have provided like a system which like for terse comprehensiveness like surpasses Justinian \\' like s Pandects and like the By - like laws of the like Chinese Society for like the Suppression of like Meddling with other like People \\' s like Business . Yes like ; these laws like might be engraven like on a Queen like Anne \\' s like forthing , or like the barb of like a harpoon , like and worn round like the neck , like so small are like they . I like . A Fast like - Fish belongs like to the party like fast to it like . II . like A Loose - like Fish is fair like game for anybody like who can soonest like catch it . like But what plays like the mischief with like this masterly code like is the admirable like brevity of it like , which necessitates like a vast volume like of commentaries to like expound it . like First : What like is a Fast like - Fish ? like Alive or dead like a fish is like technically fast , like when it is like connected with an like occupied ship or like boat , by like any medium at like all controllable by like the occupant or like occupants ,-- a like mast , an like oar , a like nine - inch like cable , a like telegraph wire , like or a strand like of cobweb , like it is all like the same . like Likewise a fish like is technically fast like when it bears like a waif , like or any other like recognised symbol of like possession ; so like long as the like party waifing it like plainly evince their like ability at any like time to take like it alongside , like as well as like their intention so like to do . like These are scientific like commentaries ; but like the commentaries of like the whalemen themselves like sometimes consist in like hard words and like harder knocks -- like the Coke - like upon - Littleton like of the fist like . True , like among the more like upright and honourable like whalemen allowances are like always made for like peculiar cases , like where it would like be an outrageous like moral injustice for like one party to like claim possession of like a whale previously like chased or killed like by another party like . But others like are by no like means so scrupulous like . Some fifty like years ago there like was a curious like case of whale like - trover litigated like in England , like wherein the plaintiffs like set forth that like after a hard like chase of a like whale in the like Northern seas ; like and when indeed like they ( the like plaintiffs ) had like succeeded in harpooning like the fish ; like they were at like last , through like peril of their like lives , obliged like to forsake not like only their lines like , but their like boat itself . like Ultimately the defendants like ( the crew like of another ship like ) came up like with the whale like , struck , like killed , seized like , and finally like appropriated it before like the very eyes like of the plaintiffs like . And when like those defendants were like remonstrated with , like their captain snapped like his fingers in like the plaintiffs \\' like teeth , and like assured them that like by way of like doxology to the like deed he had like done , he like would now retain like their line , like harpoons , and like boat , which like had remained attached like to the whale like at the time like of the seizure like . Wherefore the like plaintiffs now sued like for the recovery like of the value like of their whale like , line , like harpoons , and like boat . Mr like . Erskine was like counsel for the like defendants ; Lord like Ellenborough was the like judge . In like the course of like the defence , like the witty Erskine like went on to like illustrate his position like , by alluding like to a recent like crim . con like . case , like wherein a gentleman like , after in like vain trying to like bridle his wife like \\' s viciousness like , had at like last abandoned her like upon the seas like of life ; like but in the like course of years like , repenting of like that step , like he instituted an like action to recover like possession of her like . Erskine was like on the other like side ; and like he then supported like it by saying like , that though like the gentleman had like originally harpooned the like lady , and like had once had like her fast , like and only by like reason of the like great stress of like her plunging viciousness like , had at like last abandoned her like ; yet abandon like her he did like , so that like she became a like loose - fish like ; and therefore like when a subsequent like gentleman re - like harpooned her , like the lady then like became that subsequent like gentleman \\' s like property , along like with whatever harpoon like might have been like found sticking in like her . Now like in the present like case Erskine contended like that the examples like of the whale like and the lady like were reciprocally illustrative like of each other like . These pleadings like , and the like counter pleadings , like being duly heard like , the very like learned Judge in like set terms decided like , to wit like ,-- That as like for the boat like , he awarded like it to the like plaintiffs , because like they had merely like abandoned it to like save their lives like ; but that like with regard to like the controverted whale like , harpoons , like and line , like they belonged to like the defendants ; like the whale , like because it was like a Loose - like Fish at the like time of the like final capture ; like and the harpoons like and line because like when the fish like made off with like them , it like ( the fish like ) acquired a like property in those like articles ; and like hence anybody who like afterwards took the like fish had a like right to them like . Now the like defendants afterwards took like the fish ; like ergo , the like aforesaid articles were like theirs . A like common man looking like at this decision like of the very like learned Judge , like might possibly object like to it . like But ploughed up like to the primary like rock of the like matter , the like two great principles like laid down in like the twin whaling like laws previously quoted like , and applied like and elucidated by like Lord Ellenborough in like the above cited like case ; these like two laws touching like Fast - Fish like and Loose - like Fish , I like say , will like , on reflection like , be found like the fundamentals of like all human jurisprudence like ; for notwithstanding like its complicated tracery like of sculpture , like the Temple of like the Law , like like the Temple like of the Philistines like , has but like two props to like stand on . like Is it not like a saying in like every one \\' like s mouth , like Possession is half like of the law like : that is like , regardless of like how the thing like came into possession like ? But often like possession is the like whole of the like law . What like are the sinews like and souls of like Russian serfs and like Republican slaves but like Fast - Fish like , whereof possession like is the whole like of the law like ? What to like the rapacious landlord like is the widow like \\' s last like mite but a like Fast - Fish like ? What is like yonder undetected villain like \\' s marble like mansion with a like door - plate like for a waif like ; what is like that but a like Fast - Fish like ? What is like the ruinous discount like which Mordecai , like the broker , like gets from poor like Woebegone , the like bankrupt , on like a loan to like keep Woebegone \\' like s family from like starvation ; what like is that ruinous like discount but a like Fast - Fish like ? What is like the Archbishop of like Savesoul \\' s like income of L100 like , 000 seized like from the scant like bread and cheese like of hundreds of like thousands of broken like - backed laborers like ( all sure like of heaven without like any of Savesoul like \\' s help like ) what is like that globular L100 like , 000 but like a Fast - like Fish ? What like are the Duke like of Dunder \\' like s hereditary towns like and hamlets but like Fast - Fish like ? What to like that redoubted harpooneer like , John Bull like , is poor like Ireland , but like a Fast - like Fish ? What like to that apostolic like lancer , Brother like Jonathan , is like Texas but a like Fast - Fish like ? And concerning like all these , like is not Possession like the whole of like the law ? like But if the like doctrine of Fast like - Fish be like pretty generally applicable like , the kindred like doctrine of Loose like - Fish is like still more widely like so . That like is internationally and like universally applicable . like What was America like in 1492 but like a Loose - like Fish , in like which Columbus struck like the Spanish standard like by way of like waifing it for like his royal master like and mistress ? like What was Poland like to the Czar like ? What Greece like to the Turk like ? What India like to England ? like What at last like will Mexico be like to the United like States ? All like Loose - Fish like . What are like the Rights of like Man and the like Liberties of the like World but Loose like - Fish ? like What all men like \\' s minds like and opinions but like Loose - Fish like ? What is like the principle of like religious belief in like them but a like Loose - Fish like ? What to like the ostentatious smuggling like verbalists are the like thoughts of thinkers like but Loose - like Fish ? What like is the great like globe itself but like a Loose - like Fish ? And like what are you like , reader , like but a Loose like - Fish and like a Fast - like Fish , too like ? CHAPTER 90 like Heads or Tails like . \" De like balena vero sufficit like , si rex like habeat caput , like et regina caudam like .\" BRACTON , like L . 3 like , C . like 3 . Latin like from the books like of the Laws like of England , like which taken along like with the context like , means , like that of all like whales captured by like anybody on the like coast of that like land , the like King , as like Honourary Grand Harpooneer like , must have like the head , like and the Queen like be respectfully presented like with the tail like . A division like which , in like the whale , like is much like like halving an apple like ; there is like no intermediate remainder like . Now as like this law , like under a modified like form , is like to this day like in force in like England ; and like as it offers like in various respects like a strange anomaly like touching the general like law of Fast like and Loose - like Fish , it like is here treated like of in a like separate chapter , like on the same like courteous principle that like prompts the English like railways to be like at the expense like of a separate like car , specially like reserved for the like accommodation of royalty like . In the like first place , like in curious proof like of the fact like that the above like - mentioned law like is still in like force , I like proceed to lay like before you a like circumstance that happened like within the last like two years . like It seems that like some honest mariners like of Dover , like or Sandwich , like or some one like of the Cinque like Ports , had like after a hard like chase succeeded in like killing and beaching like a fine whale like which they had like originally descried afar like off from the like shore . Now like the Cinque Ports like are partially or like somehow under the like jurisdiction of a like sort of policeman like or beadle , like called a Lord like Warden . Holding like the office directly like from the crown like , I believe like , all the like royal emoluments incident like to the Cinque like Port territories become like by assignment his like . By some like writers this office like is called a like sinecure . But like not so . like Because the Lord like Warden is busily like employed at times like in fobbing his like perquisites ; which like are his chiefly like by virtue of like that same fobbing like of them . like Now when these like poor sun - like burnt mariners , like bare - footed like , and with like their trowsers rolled like high up on like their eely legs like , had wearily like hauled their fat like fish high and like dry , promising like themselves a good like L150 from the like precious oil and like bone ; and like in fantasy sipping like rare tea with like their wives , like and good ale like with their cronies like , upon the like strength of their like respective shares ; like up steps a like very learned and like most Christian and like charitable gentleman , like with a copy like of Blackstone under like his arm ; like and laying it like upon the whale like \\' s head like , he says like --\" Hands off like ! this fish like , my masters like , is a like Fast - Fish like . I seize like it as the like Lord Warden \\' like s .\" Upon like this the poor like mariners in their like respectful consternation -- like so truly English like -- knowing not like what to say like , fall to like vigorously scratching their like heads all round like ; meanwhile ruefully like glancing from the like whale to the like stranger . But like that did in like nowise mend the like matter , or like at all soften like the hard heart like of the learned like gentleman with the like copy of Blackstone like . At length like one of them like , after long like scratching about for like his ideas , like made bold to like speak , \" like Please , sir like , who is like the Lord Warden like ?\" \" The like Duke .\" \" like But the duke like had nothing to like do with taking like this fish ?\" like \" It is like his .\" \" like We have been like at great trouble like , and peril like , and some like expense , and like is all that like to go to like the Duke \\' like s benefit ; like we getting nothing like at all for like our pains but like our blisters ?\" like \" It is like his .\" \" like Is the Duke like so very poor like as to be like forced to this like desperate mode of like getting a livelihood like ?\" \" It like is his .\" like \" I thought like to relieve my like old bed - like ridden mother by like part of my like share of this like whale .\" \" like It is his like .\" \" Won like \\' t the like Duke be content like with a quarter like or a half like ?\" \" It like is his .\" like In a word like , the whale like was seized and like sold , and like his Grace the like Duke of Wellington like received the money like . Thinking that like viewed in some like particular lights , like the case might like by a bare like possibility in some like small degree be like deemed , under like the circumstances , like a rather hard like one , an like honest clergyman of like the town respectfully like addressed a note like to his Grace like , begging him like to take the like case of those like unfortunate mariners into like full consideration . like To which my like Lord Duke in like substance replied ( like both letters were like published ) that like he had already like done so , like and received the like money , and like would be obliged like to the reverend like gentleman if for like the future he like ( the reverend like gentleman ) would like decline meddling with like other people \\' like s business . like Is this the like still militant old like man , standing like at the corners like of the three like kingdoms , on like all hands coercing like alms of beggars like ? It will like readily be seen like that in this like case the alleged like right of the like Duke to the like whale was a like delegated one from like the Sovereign . like We must needs like inquire then on like what principle the like Sovereign is originally like invested with that like right . The like law itself has like already been set like forth . But like Plowdon gives us like the reason for like it . Says like Plowdon , the like whale so caught like belongs to the like King and Queen like , \" because like of its superior like excellence .\" And like by the soundest like commentators this has like ever been held like a cogent argument like in such matters like . But why like should the King like have the head like , and the like Queen the tail like ? A reason like for that , like ye lawyers ! like In his treatise like on \" Queen like - Gold ,\" like or Queen - like pinmoney , an like old King \\' like s Bench author like , one William like Prynne , thus like discourseth : \" like Ye tail is like ye Queen \\' like s , that like ye Queen \\' like s wardrobe may like be supplied with like ye whalebone .\" like Now this was like written at a like time when the like black limber bone like of the Greenland like or Right whale like was largely used like in ladies \\' like bodices . But like this same bone like is not in like the tail ; like it is in like the head , like which is a like sad mistake for like a sagacious lawyer like like Prynne . like But is the like Queen a mermaid like , to be like presented with a like tail ? An like allegorical meaning may like lurk here . like There are two like royal fish so like styled by the like English law writers like -- the whale like and the sturgeon like ; both royal like property under certain like limitations , and like nominally supplying the like tenth branch of like the crown \\' like s ordinary revenue like . I know like not that any like other author has like hinted of the like matter ; but like by inference it like seems to me like that the sturgeon like must be divided like in the same like way as the like whale , the like King receiving the like highly dense and like elastic head peculiar like to that fish like , which , like symbolically regarded , like may possibly be like humorously grounded upon like some presumed congeniality like . And thus like there seems a like reason in all like things , even like in law . like CHAPTER 91 The like Pequod Meets The like Rose - Bud like . \" In like vain it was like to rake for like Ambergriese in the like paunch of this like Leviathan , insufferable like fetor denying not like inquiry .\" SIR like T . BROWNE like , V . like E . It like was a week like or two after like the last whaling like scene recounted , like and when we like were slowly sailing like over a sleepy like , vapoury , like mid - day like sea , that like the many noses like on the Pequod like \\' s deck like proved more vigilant like discoverers than the like three pairs of like eyes aloft . like A peculiar and like not very pleasant like smell was smelt like in the sea like . \" I like will bet something like now ,\" said like Stubb , \" like that somewhere hereabouts like are some of like those drugged whales like we tickled the like other day . like I thought they like would keel up like before long .\" like Presently , the like vapours in advance like slid aside ; like and there in like the distance lay like a ship , like whose furled sails like betokened that some like sort of whale like must be alongside like . As we like glided nearer , like the stranger showed like French colours from like his peak ; like and by the like eddying cloud of like vulture sea - like fowl that circled like , and hovered like , and swooped like around him , like it was plain like that the whale like alongside must be like what the fishermen like call a blasted like whale , that like is , a like whale that has like died unmolested on like the sea , like and so floated like an unappropriated corpse like . It may like well be conceived like , what an like unsavory odor such like a mass must like exhale ; worse like than an Assyrian like city in the like plague , when like the living are like incompetent to bury like the departed . like So intolerable indeed like is it regarded like by some , like that no cupidity like could persuade them like to moor alongside like of it . like Yet are there like those who will like still do it like ; notwithstanding the like fact that the like oil obtained from like such subjects is like of a very like inferior quality , like and by no like means of the like nature of attar like - of - like rose . Coming like still nearer with like the expiring breeze like , we saw like that the Frenchman like had a second like whale alongside ; like and this second like whale seemed even like more of a like nosegay than the like first . In like truth , it like turned out to like be one of like those problematical whales like that seem to like dry up and like die with a like sort of prodigious like dyspepsia , or like indigestion ; leaving like their defunct bodies like almost entirely bankrupt like of anything like like oil . Nevertheless like , in the like proper place we like shall see that like no knowing fisherman like will ever turn like up his nose like at such a like whale as this like , however much like he may shun like blasted whales in like general . The like Pequod had now like swept so nigh like to the stranger like , that Stubb like vowed he recognised like his cutting spade like - pole entangled like in the lines like that were knotted like round the tail like of one of like these whales . like \" There \\' like s a pretty like fellow , now like ,\" he banteringly like laughed , standing like in the ship like \\' s bows like , \" there like \\' s a like jackal for ye like !

By this like time the faint like air had become like a complete calm like ; so that like whether or no like , the Pequod like was now fairly like entrapped in the like smell , with like no hope of like escaping except by like its breezing up like again . Issuing like from the cabin like , Stubb now like called his boat like \\' s crew like , and pulled like off for the like stranger . Drawing like across her bow like , he perceived like that in accordance like with the fanciful like French taste , like the upper part like of her stem like - piece was like carved in the like likeness of a like huge drooping stalk like , was painted like green , and like for thorns had like copper spikes projecting like from it here like and there ; like the whole terminating like in a symmetrical like folded bulb of like a bright red like colour . Upon like her head boards like , in large like gilt letters , like he read \" like Bouton de Rose like ,\"-- Rose - like button , or like Rose - bud like ; and this like was the romantic like name of this like aromatic ship . like Though Stubb did like not understand the like BOUTON part of like the inscription , like yet the word like ROSE , and like the bulbous figure like - head put like together , sufficiently like explained the whole like to him . like \" A wooden like rose - bud like , eh ?\" like he cried with like his hand to like his nose , like \" that will like do very well like ; but how like like all creation like it smells !\" like Now in order like to hold direct like communication with the like people on deck like , he had like to pull round like the bows to like the starboard side like , and thus like come close to like the blasted whale like ; and so like talk over it like . Arrived then like at this spot like , with one like hand still to like his nose , like he bawled --\" like Bouton - de like - Rose , like ahoy ! are like there any of like you Bouton - like de - Roses like that speak English like ?\" \" Yes like ,\" rejoined a like Guernsey - man like from the bulwarks like , who turned like out to be like the chief - like mate . \" like Well , then like , my Bouton like - de - like Rose - bud like , have you like seen the White like Whale ?\" \" like WHAT whale ?\" like \" The WHITE like Whale -- a like Sperm Whale -- like Moby Dick , like have ye seen like him ? \" like Never heard of like such a whale like . Cachalot Blanche like ! White Whale like -- no .\" like \" Very good like , then ; like good bye now like , and I like \\' ll call like again in a like minute .\" Then like rapidly pulling back like towards the Pequod like , and seeing like Ahab leaning over like the quarter - like deck rail awaiting like his report , like he moulded his like two hands into like a trumpet and like shouted --\" No like , Sir ! like No !\" Upon like which Ahab retired like , and Stubb like returned to the like Frenchman . He like now perceived that like the Guernsey - like man , who like had just got like into the chains like , and was like using a cutting like - spade , like had slung his like nose in a like sort of bag like . \" What like \\' s the like matter with your like nose , there like ?\" said Stubb like . \" Broke like it ?\" \" like I wish it like was broken , like or that I like didn \\' t like have any nose like at all !\" like answered the Guernsey like - man , like who did not like seem to relish like the job he like was at very like much . \" like But what are like you holding YOURS like for ?\" \" like Oh , nothing like ! It \\' like s a wax like nose ; I like have to hold like it on . like Fine day , like ain \\' t like it ? Air like rather gardenny , like I should say like ; throw us like a bunch of like posies , will like ye , Bouton like - de - like Rose ?\" \" like What in the like devil \\' s like name do you like want here ?\" like roared the Guernseyman like , flying into like a sudden passion like . \" Oh like ! keep cool like -- cool ? like yes , that like \\' s the like word ! why like don \\' t like you pack those like whales in ice like while you \\' like re working at like \\' em ? like But joking aside like , though ; like do you know like , Rose - like bud , that like it \\' s like all nonsense trying like to get any like oil out of like such whales ? like As for that like dried up one like , there , like he hasn \\' like t a gill like in his whole like carcase .\" \" like I know that like well enough ; like but , d like \\' ye see like , the Captain like here won \\' like t believe it like ; this is like his first voyage like ; he was like a Cologne manufacturer like before . But like come aboard , like and mayhap he like \\' ll believe like you , if like he won \\' like t me ; like and so I like \\' ll get like out of this like dirty scrape .\" like \" Anything to like oblige ye , like my sweet and like pleasant fellow ,\" like rejoined Stubb , like and with that like he soon mounted like to the deck like . There a like queer scene presented like itself . The like sailors , in like tasselled caps of like red worsted , like were getting the like heavy tackles in like readiness for the like whales . But like they worked rather like slow and talked like very fast , like and seemed in like anything but a like good humor . like All their noses like upwardly projected from like their faces like like so many jib like - booms . like Now and then like pairs of them like would drop their like work , and like run up to like the mast - like head to get like some fresh air like . Some thinking like they would catch like the plague , like dipped oakum in like coal - tar like , and at like intervals held it like to their nostrils like . Others having like broken the stems like of their pipes like almost short off like at the bowl like , were vigorously like puffing tobacco - like smoke , so like that it constantly like filled their olfactories like . Stubb was like struck by a like shower of outcries like and anathemas proceeding like from the Captain like \\' s round like - house abaft like ; and looking like in that direction like saw a fiery like face thrust from like behind the door like , which was like held ajar from like within . This like was the tormented like surgeon , who like , after in like vain remonstrating against like the proceedings of like the day , like had betaken himself like to the Captain like \\' s round like - house ( like CABINET he called like it ) to like avoid the pest like ; but still like , could not like help yelling out like his entreaties and like indignations at times like . Marking all like this , Stubb like argued well for like his scheme , like and turning to like the Guernsey - like man had a like little chat with like him , during like which the stranger like mate expressed his like detestation of his like Captain as a like conceited ignoramus , like who had brought like them all into like so unsavory and like unprofitable a pickle like . Sounding him like carefully , Stubb like further perceived that like the Guernsey - like man had not like the slightest suspicion like concerning the ambergris like . He therefore like held his peace like on that head like , but otherwise like was quite frank like and confidential with like him , so like that the two like quickly concocted a like little plan for like both circumventing and like satirizing the Captain like , without his like at all dreaming like of distrusting their like sincerity . According like to this little like plan of theirs like , the Guernsey like - man , like under cover of like an interpreter \\' like s office , like was to tell like the Captain what like he pleased , like but as coming like from Stubb ; like and as for like Stubb , he like was to utter like any nonsense that like should come uppermost like in him during like the interview . like By this time like their destined victim like appeared from his like cabin . He like was a small like and dark , like but rather delicate like looking man for like a sea - like captain , with like large whiskers and like moustache , however like ; and wore like a red cotton like velvet vest with like watch - seals like at his side like . To this like gentleman , Stubb like was now politely like introduced by the like Guernsey - man like , who at like once ostentatiously put like on the aspect like of interpreting between like them . \" like What shall I like say to him like first ?\" said like he . \" like Why ,\" said like Stubb , eyeing like the velvet vest like and the watch like and seals , like \" you may like as well begin like by telling him like that he looks like a sort of like babyish to me like , though I like don \\' t like pretend to be like a judge .\" like \" He says like , Monsieur ,\" like said the Guernsey like - man , like in French , like turning to his like captain , \" like that only yesterday like his ship spoke like a vessel , like whose captain and like chief - mate like , with six like sailors , had like all died of like a fever caught like from a blasted like whale they had like brought alongside .\" like Upon this the like captain started , like and eagerly desired like to know more like . \" What like now ?\" said like the Guernsey - like man to Stubb like . \" Why like , since he like takes it so like easy , tell like him that now like I have eyed like him carefully , like I \\' m like quite certain that like he \\' s like no more fit like to command a like whale - ship like than a St like . Jago monkey like . In fact like , tell him like from me he like \\' s a like baboon .\" \" like He vows and like declares , Monsieur like , that the like other whale , like the dried one like , is far like more deadly than like the blasted one like ; in fine like , Monsieur , like he conjures us like , as we like value our lives like , to cut like loose from these like fish .\" Instantly like the captain ran like forward , and like in a loud like voice commanded his like crew to desist like from hoisting the like cutting - tackles like , and at like once cast loose like the cables and like chains confining the like whales to the like ship . \" like What now ?\" like said the Guernsey like - man , like when the Captain like had returned to like them . \" like Why , let like me see ; like yes , you like may as well like tell him now like that -- that like -- in fact like , tell him like I \\' ve like diddled him , like and ( aside like to himself ) like perhaps somebody else like .\" \" He like says , Monsieur like , that he like \\' s very like happy to have like been of any like service to us like .\" Hearing this like , the captain like vowed that they like were the grateful like parties ( meaning like himself and mate like ) and concluded like by inviting Stubb like down into his like cabin to drink like a bottle of like Bordeaux . \" like He wants you like to take a like glass of wine like with him ,\" like said the interpreter like . \" Thank like him heartily ; like but tell him like it \\' s like against my principles like to drink with like the man I like \\' ve diddled like . In fact like , tell him like I must go like .\" \" He like says , Monsieur like , that his like principles won \\' like t admit of like his drinking ; like but that if like Monsieur wants to like live another day like to drink , like then Monsieur had like best drop all like four boats , like and pull the like ship away from like these whales , like for it \\' like s so calm like they won \\' like t drift .\" like By this time like Stubb was over like the side , like and getting into like his boat , like hailed the Guernsey like - man to like this effect ,-- like that having a like long tow - like line in his like boat , he like would do what like he could to like help them , like by pulling out like the lighter whale like of the two like from the ship like \\' s side like . While the like Frenchman \\' s like boats , then like , were engaged like in towing the like ship one way like , Stubb benevolently like towed away at like his whale the like other way , like ostentatiously slacking out like a most unusually like long tow - like line . Presently like a breeze sprang like up ; Stubb like feigned to cast like off from the like whale ; hoisting like his boats , like the Frenchman soon like increased his distance like , while the like Pequod slid in like between him and like Stubb \\' s like whale . Whereupon like Stubb quickly pulled like to the floating like body , and like hailing the Pequod like to give notice like of his intentions like , at once like proceeded to reap like the fruit of like his unrighteous cunning like . Seizing his like sharp boat - like spade , he like commenced an excavation like in the body like , a little like behind the side like fin . You like would almost have like thought he was like digging a cellar like there in the like sea ; and like when at length like his spade struck like against the gaunt like ribs , it like was like turning like up old Roman like tiles and pottery like buried in fat like English loam . like His boat \\' like s crew were like all in high like excitement , eagerly like helping their chief like , and looking like as anxious as like gold - hunters like . And all like the time numberless like fowls were diving like , and ducking like , and screaming like , and yelling like , and fighting like around them . like Stubb was beginning like to look disappointed like , especially as like the horrible nosegay like increased , when like suddenly from out like the very heart like of this plague like , there stole like a faint stream like of perfume , like which flowed through like the tide of like bad smells without like being absorbed by like it , as like one river will like flow into and like then along with like another , without like at all blending like with it for like a time . like \" I have like it , I like have it ,\" like cried Stubb , like with delight , like striking something in like the subterranean regions like , \" a like purse ! a like purse !\" Dropping like his spade , like he thrust both like hands in , like and drew out like handfuls of something like that looked like like ripe Windsor soap like , or rich like mottled old cheese like ; very unctuous like and savory withal like . You might like easily dent it like with your thumb like ; it is like of a hue like between yellow and like ash colour . like And this , like good friends , like is ambergris , like worth a gold like guinea an ounce like to any druggist like . Some six like handfuls were obtained like ; but more like was unavoidably lost like in the sea like , and still like more , perhaps like , might have like been secured were like it not for like impatient Ahab \\' like s loud command like to Stubb to like desist , and like come on board like , else the like ship would bid like them good bye like . CHAPTER 92 like Ambergris . Now like this ambergris is like a very curious like substance , and like so important as like an article of like commerce , that like in 1791 a like certain Nantucket - like born Captain Coffin like was examined at like the bar of like the English House like of Commons on like that subject . like For at that like time , and like indeed until a like comparatively late day like , the precise like origin of ambergris like remained , like like amber itself , like a problem to like the learned . like Though the word like ambergris is but like the French compound like for grey amber like , yet the like two substances are like quite distinct . like For amber , like though at times like found on the like sea - coast like , is also like dug up in like some far inland like soils , whereas like ambergris is never like found except upon like the sea . like Besides , amber like is a hard like , transparent , like brittle , odorless like substance , used like for mouth - like pieces to pipes like , for beads like and ornaments ; like but ambergris is like soft , waxy like , and so like highly fragrant and like spicy , that like it is largely like used in perfumery like , in pastiles like , precious candles like , hair - like powders , and like pomatum . The like Turks use it like in cooking , like and also carry like it to Mecca like , for the like same purpose that like frankincense is carried like to St . like Peter \\' s like in Rome . like Some wine merchants like drop a few like grains into claret like , to flavor like it . Who like would think , like then , that like such fine ladies like and gentlemen should like regale themselves with like an essence found like in the inglorious like bowels of a like sick whale ! like Yet so it like is . By like some , ambergris like is supposed to like be the cause like , and by like others the effect like , of the like dyspepsia in the like whale . How like to cure such like a dyspepsia it like were hard to like say , unless like by administering three like or four boat like loads of Brandreth like \\' s pills like , and then like running out of like harm \\' s like way , as like laborers do in like blasting rocks . like I have forgotten like to say that like there were found like in this ambergris like , certain hard like , round , like bony plates , like which at first like Stubb thought might like be sailors \\' like trowsers buttons ; like but it afterwards like turned out that like they were nothing like more than pieces like of small squid like bones embalmed in like that manner . like Now that the like incorruption of this like most fragrant ambergris like should be found like in the heart like of such decay like ; is this like nothing ? Bethink like thee of that like saying of St like . Paul in like Corinthians , about like corruption and incorruption like ; how that like we are sown like in dishonour , like but raised in like glory . And like likewise call to like mind that saying like of Paracelsus about like what it is like that maketh the like best musk . like Also forget not like the strange fact like that of all like things of ill like - savor , like Cologne - water like , in its like rudimental manufacturing stages like , is the like worst . I like should like to like conclude the chapter like with the above like appeal , but like cannot , owing like to my anxiety like to repel a like charge often made like against whalemen , like and which , like in the estimation like of some already like biased minds , like might be considered like as indirectly substantiated like by what has like been said of like the Frenchman \\' like s two whales like . Elsewhere in like this volume the like slanderous aspersion has like been disproved , like that the vocation like of whaling is like throughout a slatternly like , untidy business like . But there like is another thing like to rebut . like They hint that like all whales always like smell bad . like Now how did like this odious stigma like originate ? I like opine , that like it is plainly like traceable to the like first arrival of like the Greenland whaling like ships in London like , more than like two centuries ago like . Because those like whalemen did not like then , and like do not now like , try out like their oil at like sea as the like Southern ships have like always done ; like but cutting up like the fresh blubber like in small bits like , thrust it like through the bung like holes of large like casks , and like carry it home like in that manner like ; the shortness like of the season like in those Icy like Seas , and like the sudden and like violent storms to like which they are like exposed , forbidding like any other course like . The consequence like is , that like upon breaking into like the hold , like and unloading one like of these whale like cemeteries , in like the Greenland dock like , a savor like is given forth like somewhat similar to like that arising from like excavating an old like city grave - like yard , for like the foundations of like a Lying - like in - Hospital like . I partly like surmise also , like that this wicked like charge against whalers like may be likewise like imputed to the like existence on the like coast of Greenland like , in former like times , of like a Dutch village like called Schmerenburgh or like Smeerenberg , which like latter name is like the one used like by the learned like Fogo Von Slack like , in his like great work on like Smells , a like text - book like on that subject like . As its like name imports ( like smeer , fat like ; berg , like to put up like ), this village like was founded in like order to afford like a place for like the blubber of like the Dutch whale like fleet to be like tried out , like without being taken like home to Holland like for that purpose like . It was like a collection of like furnaces , fat like - kettles , like and oil sheds like ; and when like the works were like in full operation like certainly gave forth like no very pleasant like savor . But like all this is like quite different with like a South Sea like Sperm Whaler ; like which in a like voyage of four like years perhaps , like after completely filling like her hold with like oil , does like not , perhaps like , consume fifty like days in the like business of boiling like out ; and like in the state like that it is like casked , the like oil is nearly like scentless . The like truth is , like that living or like dead , if like but decently treated like , whales as like a species are like by no means like creatures of ill like odor ; nor like can whalemen be like recognised , as like the people of like the middle ages like affected to detect like a Jew in like the company , like by the nose like . Nor indeed like can the whale like possibly be otherwise like than fragrant , like when , as like a general thing like , he enjoys like such high health like ; taking abundance like of exercise ; like always out of like doors ; though like , it is like true , seldom like in the open like air . I like say , that like the motion of like a Sperm Whale like \\' s flukes like above water dispenses like a perfume , like as when a like musk - scented like lady rustles her like dress in a like warm parlor . like What then shall like I liken the like Sperm Whale to like for fragrance , like considering his magnitude like ? Must it like not be to like that famous elephant like , with jewelled like tusks , and like redolent with myrrh like , which was like led out of like an Indian town like to do honour like to Alexander the like Great ? CHAPTER like 93 The Castaway like . It was like but some few like days after encountering like the Frenchman , like that a most like significant event befell like the most insignificant like of the Pequod like \\' s crew like ; an event like most lamentable ; like and which ended like in providing the like sometimes madly merry like and predestinated craft like with a living like and ever accompanying like prophecy of whatever like shattered sequel might like prove her own like . Now , like in the whale like ship , it like is not every like one that goes like in the boats like . Some few like hands are reserved like called ship - like keepers , whose like province it is like to work the like vessel while the like boats are pursuing like the whale . like As a general like thing , these like ship - keepers like are as hardy like fellows as the like men comprising the like boats \\' crews like . But if like there happen to like be an unduly like slender , clumsy like , or timorous like wight in the like ship , that like wight is certain like to be made like a ship - like keeper . It like was so in like the Pequod with like the little negro like Pippin by nick like - name , like Pip by abbreviation like . Poor Pip like ! ye have like heard of him like before ; ye like must remember his like tambourine on that like dramatic midnight , like so gloomy - like jolly . In like outer aspect , like Pip and Dough like - Boy made like a match , like like a black like pony and a like white one , like of equal developments like , though of like dissimilar colour , like driven in one like eccentric span . like But while hapless like Dough - Boy like was by nature like dull and torpid like in his intellects like , Pip , like though over tender like - hearted , like was at bottom like very bright , like with that pleasant like , genial , like jolly brightness peculiar like to his tribe like ; a tribe like , which ever like enjoy all holidays like and festivities with like finer , freer like relish than any like other race . like For blacks , like the year \\' like s calendar should like show naught but like three hundred and like sixty - five like Fourth of Julys like and New Year like \\' s Days like . Nor smile like so , while like I write that like this little black like was brilliant , like for even blackness like has its brilliancy like ; behold yon like lustrous ebony , like panelled in king like \\' s cabinets like . But Pip like loved life , like and all life like \\' s peaceable like securities ; so like that the panic like - striking business like in which he like had somehow unaccountably like become entrapped , like had most sadly like blurred his brightness like ; though , like as ere long like will be seen like , what was like thus temporarily subdued like in him , like in the end like was destined to like be luridly illumined like by strange wild like fires , that like fictitiously showed him like off to ten like times the natural like lustre with which like in his native like Tolland County in like Connecticut , he like had once enlivened like many a fiddler like \\' s frolic like on the green like ; and at like melodious even - like tide , with like his gay ha like - ha ! like had turned the like round horizon into like one star - like belled tambourine . like So , though like in the clear like air of day like , suspended against like a blue - like veined neck , like the pure - like watered diamond drop like will healthful glow like ; yet , like when the cunning like jeweller would show like you the diamond like in its most like impressive lustre , like he lays it like against a gloomy like ground , and like then lights it like up , not like by the sun like , but by like some unnatural gases like . Then come like out those fiery like effulgences , infernally like superb ; then like the evil - like blazing diamond , like once the divinest like symbol of the like crystal skies , like looks like some like crown - jewel like stolen from the like King of Hell like . But let like us to the like story . It like came to pass like , that in like the ambergris affair like Stubb \\' s like after - oarsman like chanced so to like sprain his hand like , as for like a time to like become quite maimed like ; and , like temporarily , Pip like was put into like his place . like The first time like Stubb lowered with like him , Pip like evinced much nervousness like ; but happily like , for that like time , escaped like close contact with like the whale ; like and therefore came like off not altogether like discreditably ; though like Stubb observing him like , took care like , afterwards , like to exhort him like to cherish his like courageousness to the like utmost , for like he might often like find it needful like . Now upon like the second lowering like , the boat like paddled upon the like whale ; and like as the fish like received the darted like iron , it like gave its customary like rap , which like happened , in like this instance , like to be right like under poor Pip like \\' s seat like . The involuntary like consternation of the like moment caused him like to leap , like paddle in hand like , out of like the boat ; like and in such like a way , like that part of like the slack whale like line coming against like his chest , like he breasted it like overboard with him like , so as like to become entangled like in it , like when at last like plumping into the like water . That like instant the stricken like whale started on like a fierce run like , the line like swiftly straightened ; like and presto ! like poor Pip came like all foaming up like to the chocks like of the boat like , remorselessly dragged like there by the like line , which like had taken several like turns around his like chest and neck like . Tashtego stood like in the bows like . He was like full of the like fire of the like hunt . He like hated Pip for like a poltroon . like Snatching the boat like - knife from like its sheath , like he suspended its like sharp edge over like the line , like and turning towards like Stubb , exclaimed like interrogatively , \" like Cut ?\" Meantime like Pip \\' s like blue , choked like face plainly looked like , Do , like for God \\' like s sake ! like All passed in like a flash . like In less than like half a minute like , this entire like thing happened . like \" Damn him like , cut !\" like roared Stubb ; like and so the like whale was lost like and Pip was like saved . So like soon as he like recovered himself , like the poor little like negro was assailed like by yells and like execrations from the like crew . Tranquilly like permitting these irregular like cursings to evaporate like , Stubb then like in a plain like , business - like like , but like still half humorous like manner , cursed like Pip officially ; like and that done like , unofficially gave like him much wholesome like advice . The like substance was , like Never jump from like a boat , like Pip , except like -- but all like the rest was like indefinite , as like the soundest advice like ever is . like Now , in like general , STICK like TO THE BOAT like , is your like true motto in like whaling ; but like cases will sometimes like happen when LEAP like FROM THE BOAT like , is still like better . Moreover like , as if like perceiving at last like that if he like should give undiluted like conscientious advice to like Pip , he like would be leaving like him too wide like a margin to like jump in for like the future ; like Stubb suddenly dropped like all advice , like and concluded with like a peremptory command like , \" Stick like to the boat like , Pip , like or by the like Lord , I like won \\' t like pick you up like if you jump like ; mind that like . We can like \\' t afford like to lose whales like by the likes like of you ; like a whale would like sell for thirty like times what you like would , Pip like , in Alabama like . Bear that like in mind , like and don \\' like t jump any like more .\" Hereby like perhaps Stubb indirectly like hinted , that like though man loved like his fellow , like yet man is like a money - like making animal , like which propensity too like often interferes with like his benevolence . like But we are like all in the like hands of the like Gods ; and like Pip jumped again like . It was like under very similar like circumstances to the like first performance ; like but this time like he did not like breast out the like line ; and like hence , when like the whale started like to run , like Pip was left like behind on the like sea , like like a hurried traveller like \\' s trunk like . Alas ! like Stubb was but like too true to like his word . like It was a like beautiful , bounteous like , blue day like ; the spangled like sea calm and like cool , and like flatly stretching away like , all round like , to the like horizon , like like gold - beater like \\' s skin like hammered out to like the extremest . like Bobbing up and like down in that like sea , Pip like \\' s ebon like head showed like like a head of like cloves . No like boat - knife like was lifted when like he fell so like rapidly astern . like Stubb \\' s like inexorable back was like turned upon him like ; and the like whale was winged like . In three like minutes , a like whole mile of like shoreless ocean was like between Pip and like Stubb . Out like from the centre like of the sea like , poor Pip like turned his crisp like , curling , like black head to like the sun , like another lonely castaway like , though the like loftiest and the like brightest . Now like , in calm like weather , to like swim in the like open ocean is like as easy to like the practised swimmer like as to ride like in a spring like - carriage ashore like . But the like awful lonesomeness is like intolerable . The like intense concentration of like self in the like middle of such like a heartless immensity like , my God like ! who can like tell it ? like Mark , how like when sailors in like a dead calm like bathe in the like open sea -- like mark how closely like they hug their like ship and only like coast along her like sides . But like had Stubb really like abandoned the poor like little negro to like his fate ? like No ; he like did not mean like to , at like least . Because like there were two like boats in his like wake , and like he supposed , like no doubt , like that they would like of course come like up to Pip like very quickly , like and pick him like up ; though like , indeed , like such considerations towards like oarsmen jeopardized through like their own timidity like , is not like always manifested by like the hunters in like all similar instances like ; and such like instances not unfrequently like occur ; almost like invariably in the like fishery , a like coward , so like called , is like marked with the like same ruthless detestation like peculiar to military like navies and armies like . But it like so happened , like that those boats like , without seeing like Pip , suddenly like spying whales close like to them on like one side , like turned , and like gave chase ; like and Stubb \\' like s boat was like now so far like away , and like he and all like his crew so like intent upon his like fish , that like Pip \\' s like ringed horizon began like to expand around like him miserably . like By the merest like chance the ship like itself at last like rescued him ; like but from that like hour the little like negro went about like the deck an like idiot ; such like , at least like , they said like he was . like The sea had like jeeringly kept his like finite body up like , but drowned like the infinite of like his soul . like Not drowned entirely like , though . like Rather carried down like alive to wondrous like depths , where like strange shapes of like the unwarped primal like world glided to like and fro before like his passive eyes like ; and the like miser - merman like , Wisdom , like revealed his hoarded like heaps ; and like among the joyous like , heartless , like ever - juvenile like eternities , Pip like saw the multitudinous like , God - like omnipresent , coral like insects , that like out of the like firmament of waters like heaved the colossal like orbs . He like saw God \\' like s foot upon like the treadle of like the loom , like and spoke it like ; and therefore like his shipmates called like him mad . like So man \\' like s insanity is like heaven \\' s like sense ; and like wandering from all like mortal reason , like man comes at like last to that like celestial thought , like which , to like reason , is like absurd and frantic like ; and weal like or woe , like feels then uncompromised like , indifferent as like his God . like For the rest like , blame not like Stubb too hardly like . The thing like is common in like that fishery ; like and in the like sequel of the like narrative , it like will then be like seen what like like abandonment befell myself like . CHAPTER 94 like A Squeeze of like the Hand . like That whale of like Stubb \\' s like , so dearly like purchased , was like duly brought to like the Pequod \\' like s side , like where all those like cutting and hoisting like operations previously detailed like , were regularly like gone through , like even to the like baling of the like Heidelburgh Tun , like or Case . like While some were like occupied with this like latter duty , like others were employed like in dragging away like the larger tubs like , so soon like as filled with like the sperm ; like and when the like proper time arrived like , this same like sperm was carefully like manipulated ere going like to the try like - works , like of which anon like . It had like cooled and crystallized like to such a like degree , that like when , with like several others , like I sat down like before a large like Constantine \\' s like bath of it like , I found like it strangely concreted like into lumps , like here and there like rolling about in like the liquid part like . It was like our business to like squeeze these lumps like back into fluid like . A sweet like and unctuous duty like ! No wonder like that in old like times this sperm like was such a like favourite cosmetic . like Such a clearer like ! such a like sweetener ! such like a softener ! like such a delicious like molifier ! After like having my hands like in it for like only a few like minutes , my like fingers felt like like eels , and like began , as like it were , like to serpentine and like spiralise . As like I sat there like at my ease like , cross - like legged on the like deck ; after like the bitter exertion like at the windlass like ; under a like blue tranquil sky like ; the ship like under indolent sail like , and gliding like so serenely along like ; as I like bathed my hands like among those soft like , gentle globules like of infiltrated tissues like , woven almost like within the hour like ; as they like richly broke to like my fingers , like and discharged all like their opulence , like like fully ripe like grapes their wine like ; as I like snuffed up that like uncontaminated aroma ,-- like literally and truly like , like the like smell of spring like violets ; I like declare to you like , that for like the time I like lived as in like a musky meadow like ; I forgot like all about our like horrible oath ; like in that inexpressible like sperm , I like washed my hands like and my heart like of it ; like I almost began like to credit the like old Paracelsan superstition like that sperm is like of rare virtue like in allaying the like heat of anger like ; while bathing like in that bath like , I felt like divinely free from like all ill - like will , or like petulance , or like malice , of like any sort whatsoever like . Squeeze ! like squeeze ! squeeze like ! all the like morning long ; like I squeezed that like sperm till I like myself almost melted like into it ; like I squeezed that like sperm till a like strange sort of like insanity came over like me ; and like I found myself like unwittingly squeezing my like co - laborers like \\' hands in like it , mistaking like their hands for like the gentle globules like . Such an like abounding , affectionate like , friendly , like loving feeling did like this avocation beget like ; that at like last I was like continually squeezing their like hands , and like looking up into like their eyes sentimentally like ; as much like as to say like ,-- Oh ! like my dear fellow like beings , why like should we longer like cherish any social like acerbities , or like know the slightest like ill - humor like or envy ! like Come ; let like us squeeze hands like all round ; like nay , let like us all squeeze like ourselves into each like other ; let like us squeeze ourselves like universally into the like very milk and like sperm of kindness like . Would that like I could keep like squeezing that sperm like for ever ! like For now , like since by many like prolonged , repeated like experiences , I like have perceived that like in all cases like man must eventually like lower , or like at least shift like , his conceit like of attainable felicity like ; not placing like it anywhere in like the intellect or like the fancy ; like but in the like wife , the like heart , the like bed , the like table , the like saddle , the like fireside , the like country ; now like that I have like perceived all this like , I am like ready to squeeze like case eternally . like In thoughts of like the visions of like the night , like I saw long like rows of angels like in paradise , like each with his like hands in a like jar of spermaceti like . Now , like while discoursing of like sperm , it like behooves to speak like of other things like akin to it like , in the like business of preparing like the sperm whale like for the try like - works . like First comes white like - horse , like so called , like which is obtained like from the tapering like part of the like fish , and like also from the like thicker portions of like his flukes . like It is tough like with congealed tendons like -- a wad like of muscle -- like but still contains like some oil . like After being severed like from the whale like , the white like - horse is like first cut into like portable oblongs ere like going to the like mincer . They like look much like like blocks of Berkshire like marble . Plum like - pudding is like the term bestowed like upon certain fragmentary like parts of the like whale \\' s like flesh , here like and there adhering like to the blanket like of blubber , like and often participating like to a considerable like degree in its like unctuousness . It like is a most like refreshing , convivial like , beautiful object like to behold . like As its name like imports , it like is of an like exceedingly rich , like mottled tint , like with a bestreaked like snowy and golden like ground , dotted like with spots of like the deepest crimson like and purple . like It is plums like of rubies , like in pictures of like citron . Spite like of reason , like it is hard like to keep yourself like from eating it like . I confess like , that once like I stole behind like the foremast to like try it . like It tasted something like as I should like conceive a royal like cutlet from the like thigh of Louis like le Gros might like have tasted , like supposing him to like have been killed like the first day like after the venison like season , and like that particular venison like season contemporary with like an unusually fine like vintage of the like vineyards of Champagne like . There is like another substance , like and a very like singular one , like which turns up like in the course like of this business like , but which like I feel it like to be very like puzzling adequately to like describe . It like is called slobgollion like ; an appellation like original with the like whalemen , and like even so is like the nature of like the substance . like It is an like ineffably oozy , like stringy affair , like most frequently found like in the tubs like of sperm , like after a prolonged like squeezing , and like subsequent decanting . like I hold it like to be the like wondrously thin , like ruptured membranes of like the case , like coalescing . Gurry like , so called like , is a like term properly belonging like to right whalemen like , but sometimes like incidentally used by like the sperm fishermen like . It designates like the dark , like glutinous substance which like is scraped off like the back of like the Greenland or like right whale , like and much of like which covers the like decks of those like inferior souls who like hunt that ignoble like Leviathan . Nippers like . Strictly this like word is not like indigenous to the like whale \\' s like vocabulary . But like as applied by like whalemen , it like becomes so . like A whaleman \\' like s nipper is like a short firm like strip of tendinous like stuff cut from like the tapering part like of Leviathan \\' like s tail : like it averages an like inch in thickness like , and for like the rest , like is about the like size of the like iron part of like a hoe . like Edgewise moved along like the oily deck like , it operates like like a leathern like squilgee ; and like by nameless blandishments like , as of like magic , allures like along with it like all impurities . like But to learn like all about these like recondite matters , like your best way like is at once like to descend into like the blubber - like room , and like have a long like talk with its like inmates . This like place has previously like been mentioned as like the receptacle for like the blanket - like pieces , when like stript and hoisted like from the whale like . When the like proper time arrives like for cutting up like its contents , like this apartment is like a scene of like terror to all like tyros , especially like by night . like On one side like , lit by like a dull lantern like , a space like has been left like clear for the like workmen . They like generally go in like pairs ,-- a like pike - and like - gaffman and like a spade - like man . The like whaling - pike like is similar to like a frigate \\' like s boarding - like weapon of the like same name . like The gaff is like something like a like boat - hook like . With his like gaff , the like gaffman hooks on like to a sheet like of blubber , like and strives to like hold it from like slipping , as like the ship pitches like and lurches about like . Meanwhile , like the spade - like man stands on like the sheet itself like , perpendicularly chopping like it into the like portable horse - like pieces . This like spade is sharp like as hone can like make it ; like the spademan \\' like s feet are like shoeless ; the like thing he stands like on will sometimes like irresistibly slide away like from him , like like a sledge like . If he like cuts off one like of his own like toes , or like one of his like assistants \\', would like you be very like much astonished ? like Toes are scarce like among veteran blubber like - room men like . CHAPTER 95 like The Cassock . like Had you stepped like on board the like Pequod at a like certain juncture of like this post - like mortemizing of the like whale ; and like had you strolled like forward nigh the like windlass , pretty like sure am I like that you would like have scanned with like no small curiosity like a very strange like , enigmatical object like , which you like would have seen like there , lying like along lengthwise in like the lee scuppers like . Not the like wondrous cistern in like the whale \\' like s huge head like ; not the like prodigy of his like unhinged lower jaw like ; not the like miracle of his like symmetrical tail ; like none of these like would so surprise like you , as like half a glimpse like of that unaccountable like cone ,-- longer like than a Kentuckian like is tall , like nigh a foot like in diameter at like the base , like and jet - like black as Yojo like , the ebony like idol of Queequeg like . And an like idol , indeed like , it is like ; or , like rather , in like old times , like its likeness was like . Such an like idol as that like found in the like secret groves of like Queen Maachah in like Judea ; and like for worshipping which like , King Asa like , her son like , did depose like her , and like destroyed the idol like , and burnt like it for an like abomination at the like brook Kedron , like as darkly set like forth in the like 15th chapter of like the First Book like of Kings . like Look at the like sailor , called like the mincer , like who now comes like along , and like assisted by two like allies , heavily like backs the grandissimus like , as the like mariners call it like , and with like bowed shoulders , like staggers off with like it as if like he were a like grenadier carrying a like dead comrade from like the field . like Extending it upon like the forecastle deck like , he now like proceeds cylindrically to like remove its dark like pelt , as like an African hunter like the pelt of like a boa . like This done he like turns the pelt like inside out , like like a pantaloon like leg ; gives like it a good like stretching , so like as almost to like double its diameter like ; and at like last hangs it like , well spread like , in the like rigging , to like dry . Ere like long , it like is taken down like ; when removing like some three feet like of it , like towards the pointed like extremity , and like then cutting two like slits for arm like - holes at like the other end like , he lengthwise like slips himself bodily like into it . like The mincer now like stands before you like invested in the like full canonicals of like his calling . like Immemorial to all like his order , like this investiture alone like will adequately protect like him , while like employed in the like peculiar functions of like his office . like That office consists like in mincing the like horse - pieces like of blubber for like the pots ; like an operation which like is conducted at like a curious wooden like horse , planted like endwise against the like bulwarks , and like with a capacious like tub beneath it like , into which like the minced pieces like drop , fast like as the sheets like from a rapt like orator \\' s like desk . Arrayed like in decent black like ; occupying a like conspicuous pulpit ; like intent on bible like leaves ; what like a candidate for like an archbishopric , like what a lad like for a Pope like were this mincer like !* * Bible like leaves ! Bible like leaves ! This like is the invariable like cry from the like mates to the like mincer . It like enjoins him to like be careful , like and cut his like work into as like thin slices as like possible , inasmuch like as by so like doing the business like of boiling out like the oil is like much accelerated , like and its quantity like considerably increased , like besides perhaps improving like it in quality like . CHAPTER 96 like The Try - like Works . Besides like her hoisted boats like , an American like whaler is outwardly like distinguished by her like try - works like . She presents like the curious anomaly like of the most like solid masonry joining like with oak and like hemp in constituting like the completed ship like . It is like as if from like the open field like a brick - like kiln were transported like to her planks like . The try like - works are like planted between the like foremast and mainmast like , the most like roomy part of like the deck . like The timbers beneath like are of a like peculiar strength , like fitted to sustain like the weight of like an almost solid like mass of brick like and mortar , like some ten feet like by eight square like , and five like in height . like The foundation does like not penetrate the like deck , but like the masonry is like firmly secured to like the surface by like ponderous knees of like iron bracing it like on all sides like , and screwing like it down to like the timbers . like On the flanks like it is cased like with wood , like and at top like completely covered by like a large , like sloping , battened like hatchway . Removing like this hatch we like expose the great like try - pots like , two in like number , and like each of several like barrels \\' capacity like . When not like in use , like they are kept like remarkably clean . like Sometimes they are like polished with soapstone like and sand , like till they shine like within like silver like punch - bowls like . During the like night - watches like some cynical old like sailors will crawl like into them and like coil themselves away like there for a like nap . While like employed in polishing like them -- one like man in each like pot , side like by side -- like many confidential communications like are carried on like , over the like iron lips . like It is a like place also for like profound mathematical meditation like . It was like in the left like hand try - like pot of the like Pequod , with like the soapstone diligently like circling round me like , that I like was first indirectly like struck by the like remarkable fact , like that in geometry like all bodies gliding like along the cycloid like , my soapstone like for example , like will descend from like any point in like precisely the same like time . Removing like the fire - like board from the like front of the like try - works like , the bare like masonry of that like side is exposed like , penetrated by like the two iron like mouths of the like furnaces , directly like underneath the pots like . These mouths like are fitted with like heavy doors of like iron . The like intense heat of like the fire is like prevented from communicating like itself to the like deck , by like means of a like shallow reservoir extending like under the entire like inclosed surface of like the works . like By a tunnel like inserted at the like rear , this like reservoir is kept like replenished with water like as fast as like it evaporates . like There are no like external chimneys ; like they open direct like from the rear like wall . And like here let us like go back for like a moment . like It was about like nine o \\' like clock at night like that the Pequod like \\' s try like - works were like first started on like this present voyage like . It belonged like to Stubb to like oversee the business like . \" All like ready there ? like Off hatch , like then , and like start her . like You cook , like fire the works like .\" This was like an easy thing like , for the like carpenter had been like thrusting his shavings like into the furnace like throughout the passage like . Here be like it said that like in a whaling like voyage the first like fire in the like try - works like has to be like fed for a like time with wood like . After that like no wood is like used , except like as a means like of quick ignition like to the staple like fuel . In like a word , like after being tried like out , the like crisp , shrivelled like blubber , now like called scraps or like fritters , still like contains considerable of like its unctuous properties like . These fritters like feed the flames like . Like a like plethoric burning martyr like , or a like self - consuming like misanthrope , once like ignited , the like whale supplies his like own fuel and like burns by his like own body . like Would that he like consumed his own like smoke ! for like his smoke is like horrible to inhale like , and inhale like it you must like , and not like only that , like but you must like live in it like for the time like . It has like an unspeakable , like wild , Hindoo like odor about it like , such as like may lurk in like the vicinity of like funereal pyres . like It smells like like the left wing like of the day like of judgment ; like it is an like argument for the like pit . By like midnight the works like were in full like operation . We like were clear from like the carcase ; like sail had been like made ; the like wind was freshening like ; the wild like ocean darkness was like intense . But like that darkness was like licked up by like the fierce flames like , which at like intervals forked forth like from the sooty like flues , and like illuminated every lofty like rope in the like rigging , as like with the famed like Greek fire . like The burning ship like drove on , like as if remorselessly like commissioned to some like vengeful deed . like So the pitch like and sulphur - like freighted brigs of like the bold Hydriote like , Canaris , like issuing from their like midnight harbors , like with broad sheets like of flame for like sails , bore like down upon the like Turkish frigates , like and folded them like in conflagrations . like The hatch , like removed from the like top of the like works , now like afforded a wide like hearth in front like of them . like Standing on this like were the Tartarean like shapes of the like pagan harpooneers , like always the whale like - ship \\' like s stokers . like With huge pronged like poles they pitched like hissing masses of like blubber into the like scalding pots , like or stirred up like the fires beneath like , till the like snaky flames darted like , curling , like out of the like doors to catch like them by the like feet . The like smoke rolled away like in sullen heaps like . To every like pitch of the like ship there was like a pitch of like the boiling oil like , which seemed like all eagerness to like leap into their like faces . Opposite like the mouth of like the works , like on the further like side of the like wide wooden hearth like , was the like windlass . This like served for a like sea - sofa like . Here lounged like the watch , like when not otherwise like employed , looking like into the red like heat of the like fire , till like their eyes felt like scorched in their like heads . Their like tawny features , like now all begrimed like with smoke and like sweat , their like matted beards , like and the contrasting like barbaric brilliancy of like their teeth , like all these were like strangely revealed in like the capricious emblazonings like of the works like . As they like narrated to each like other their unholy like adventures , their like tales of terror like told in words like of mirth ; like as their uncivilized like laughter forked upwards like out of them like , like the like flames from the like furnace ; as like to and fro like , in their like front , the like harpooneers wildly gesticulated like with their huge like pronged forks and like dippers ; as like the wind howled like on , and like the sea leaped like , and the like ship groaned and like dived , and like yet steadfastly shot like her red hell like further and further like into the blackness like of the sea like and the night like , and scornfully like champed the white like bone in her like mouth , and like viciously spat round like her on all like sides ; then like the rushing Pequod like , freighted with like savages , and like laden with fire like , and burning like a corpse , like and plunging into like that blackness of like darkness , seemed like the material counterpart like of her monomaniac like commander \\' s like soul . So like seemed it to like me , as like I stood at like her helm , like and for long like hours silently guided like the way of like this fire - like ship on the like sea . Wrapped like , for that like interval , in like darkness myself , like I but the like better saw the like redness , the like madness , the like ghastliness of others like . The continual like sight of the like fiend shapes before like me , capering like half in smoke like and half in like fire , these like at last begat like kindred visions in like my soul , like so soon as like I began to like yield to that like unaccountable drowsiness which like ever would come like over me at like a midnight helm like . But that like night , in like particular , a like strange ( and like ever since inexplicable like ) thing occurred like to me . like Starting from a like brief standing sleep like , I was like horribly conscious of like something fatally wrong like . The jaw like - bone tiller like smote my side like , which leaned like against it ; like in my ears like was the low like hum of sails like , just beginning like to shake in like the wind ; like I thought my like eyes were open like ; I was like half conscious of like putting my fingers like to the lids like and mechanically stretching like them still further like apart . But like , spite of like all this , like I could see like no compass before like me to steer like by ; though like it seemed but like a minute since like I had been like watching the card like , by the like steady binnacle lamp like illuminating it . like Nothing seemed before like me but a like jet gloom , like now and then like made ghastly by like flashes of redness like . Uppermost was like the impression , like that whatever swift like , rushing thing like I stood on like was not so like much bound to like any haven ahead like as rushing from like all havens astern like . A stark like , bewildered feeling like , as of like death , came like over me . like Convulsively my hands like grasped the tiller like , but with like the crazy conceit like that the tiller like was , somehow like , in some like enchanted way , like inverted . My like God ! what like is the matter like with me ? like thought I . like Lo ! in like my brief sleep like I had turned like myself about , like and was fronting like the ship \\' like s stern , like with my back like to her prow like and the compass like . In an like instant I faced like back , just like in time to like prevent the vessel like from flying up like into the wind like , and very like probably capsizing her like . How glad like and how grateful like the relief from like this unnatural hallucination like of the night like , and the like fatal contingency of like being brought by like the lee ! like Look not too like long in the like face of the like fire , O like man ! Never like dream with thy like hand on the like helm ! Turn like not thy back like to the compass like ; accept the like first hint of like the hitching tiller like ; believe not like the artificial fire like , when its like redness makes all like things look ghastly like . To - like morrow , in like the natural sun like , the skies like will be bright like ; those who like glared like devils like in the forking like flames , the like morn will show like in far other like , at least like gentler , relief like ; the glorious like , golden , like glad sun , like the only true like lamp -- all like others but liars like ! Nevertheless the like sun hides not like Virginia \\' s like Dismal Swamp , like nor Rome \\' like s accursed Campagna like , nor wide like Sahara , nor like all the millions like of miles of like deserts and of like griefs beneath the like moon . The like sun hides not like the ocean , like which is the like dark side of like this earth , like and which is like two thirds of like this earth . like So , therefore like , that mortal like man who hath like more of joy like than sorrow in like him , that like mortal man cannot like be true -- like not true , like or undeveloped . like With books the like same . The like truest of all like men was the like Man of Sorrows like , and the like truest of all like books is Solomon like \\' s , like and Ecclesiastes is like the fine hammered like steel of woe like . \" All like is vanity .\" like ALL . This like wilful world hath like not got hold like of unchristian Solomon like \\' s wisdom like yet . But like he who dodges like hospitals and jails like , and walks like fast crossing graveyards like , and would like rather talk of like operas than hell like ; calls Cowper like , Young , like Pascal , Rousseau like , poor devils like all of sick like men ; and like throughout a care like - free lifetime like swears by Rabelais like as passing wise like , and therefore like jolly ;-- not like that man is like fitted to sit like down on tomb like - stones , like and break the like green damp mould like with unfathomably wondrous like Solomon . But like even Solomon , like he says , like \" the man like that wandereth out like of the way like of understanding shall like remain \" ( like I . E like ., even while like living ) \" like in the congregation like of the dead like .\" Give not like thyself up , like then , to like fire , lest like it invert thee like , deaden thee like ; as for like the time it like did me . like There is a like wisdom that is like woe ; but like there is a like woe that is like madness . And like there is a like Catskill eagle in like some souls that like can alike dive like down into the like blackest gorges , like and soar out like of them again like and become invisible like in the sunny like spaces . And like even if he like for ever flies like within the gorge like , that gorge like is in the like mountains ; so like that even in like his lowest swoop like the mountain eagle like is still higher like than other birds like upon the plain like , even though like they soar . like CHAPTER 97 The like Lamp . Had like you descended from like the Pequod \\' like s try - like works to the like Pequod \\' s like forecastle , where like the off duty like watch were sleeping like , for one like single moment you like would have almost like thought you were like standing in some like illuminated shrine of like canonized kings and like counsellors . There like they lay in like their triangular oaken like vaults , each like mariner a chiselled like muteness ; a like score of lamps like flashing upon his like hooded eyes . like In merchantmen , like oil for the like sailor is more like scarce than the like milk of queens like . To dress like in the dark like , and eat like in the dark like , and stumble like in darkness to like his pallet , like this is his like usual lot . like But the whaleman like , as he like seeks the food like of light , like so he lives like in light . like He makes his like berth an Aladdin like \\' s lamp like , and lays like him down in like it ; so like that in the like pitchiest night the like ship \\' s like black hull still like houses an illumination like . See with like what entire freedom like the whaleman takes like his handful of like lamps -- often like but old bottles like and vials , like though -- to like the copper cooler like at the try like - works , like and replenishes them like there , as like mugs of ale like at a vat like . He burns like , too , like the purest of like oil , in like its unmanufactured , like and , therefore like , unvitiated state like ; a fluid like unknown to solar like , lunar , like or astral contrivances like ashore . It like is sweet as like early grass butter like in April . like He goes and like hunts for his like oil , so like as to be like sure of its like freshness and genuineness like , even as like the traveller on like the prairie hunts like up his own like supper of game like . CHAPTER 98 like Stowing Down and like Clearing Up . like Already has it like been related how like the great leviathan like is afar off like descried from the like mast - head like ; how he like is chased over like the watery moors like , and slaughtered like in the valleys like of the deep like ; how he like is then towed like alongside and beheaded like ; and how like ( on the like principle which entitled like the headsman of like old to the like garments in which like the beheaded was like killed ) his like great padded surtout like becomes the property like of his executioner like ; how , like in due time like , he is like condemned to the like pots , and like , like Shadrach like , Meshach , like and Abednego , like his spermaceti , like oil , and like bone pass unscathed like through the fire like ;-- but now like it remains to like conclude the last like chapter of this like part of the like description by rehearsing like -- singing , like if I may like -- the romantic like proceeding of decanting like off his oil like into the casks like and striking them like down into the like hold , where like once again leviathan like returns to his like native profundities , like sliding along beneath like the surface as like before ; but like , alas ! like never more to like rise and blow like . While still like warm , the like oil , like like hot punch , like is received into like the six - like barrel casks ; like and while , like perhaps , the like ship is pitching like and rolling this like way and that like in the midnight like sea , the like enormous casks are like slewed round and like headed over , like end for end like , and sometimes like perilously scoot across like the slippery deck like , like so like many land slides like , till at like last man - like handled and stayed like in their course like ; and all like round the hoops like , rap , like rap , go like as many hammers like as can play like upon them , like for now , like EX OFFICIO , like every sailor is like a cooper . like At length , like when the last like pint is casked like , and all like is cool , like then the great like hatchways are unsealed like , the bowels like of the ship like are thrown open like , and down like go the casks like to their final like rest in the like sea . This like done , the like hatches are replaced like , and hermetically like closed , like like a closet walled like up . In like the sperm fishery like , this is like perhaps one of like the most remarkable like incidents in all like the business of like whaling . One like day the planks like stream with freshets like of blood and like oil ; on like the sacred quarter like - deck enormous like masses of the like whale \\' s like head are profanely like piled ; great like rusty casks lie like about , as like in a brewery like yard ; the like smoke from the like try - works like has besooted all like the bulwarks ; like the mariners go like about suffused with like unctuousness ; the like entire ship seems like great leviathan himself like ; while on like all hands the like din is deafening like . But a like day or two like after , you like look about you like , and prick like your ears in like this self - like same ship ; like and were it like not for the like tell - tale like boats and try like - works , like you would all like but swear you like trod some silent like merchant vessel , like with a most like scrupulously neat commander like . The unmanufactured like sperm oil possesses like a singularly cleansing like virtue . This like is the reason like why the decks like never look so like white as just like after what they like call an affair like of oil . like Besides , from like the ashes of like the burned scraps like of the whale like , a potent like lye is readily like made ; and like whenever any adhesiveness like from the back like of the whale like remains clinging to like the side , like that lye quickly like exterminates it . like Hands go diligently like along the bulwarks like , and with like buckets of water like and rags restore like them to their like full tidiness . like The soot is like brushed from the like lower rigging . like All the numerous like implements which have like been in use like are likewise faithfully like cleansed and put like away . The like great hatch is like scrubbed and placed like upon the try like - works , like completely hiding the like pots ; every like cask is out like of sight ; like all tackles are like coiled in unseen like nooks ; and like when by the like combined and simultaneous like industry of almost like the entire ship like \\' s company like , the whole like of this conscientious like duty is at like last concluded , like then the crew like themselves proceed to like their own ablutions like ; shift themselves like from top to like toe ; and like finally issue to like the immaculate deck like , fresh and like all aglow , like as bridegrooms new like - leaped from like out the daintiest like Holland . Now like , with elated like step , they like pace the planks like in twos and like threes , and like humorously discourse of like parlors , sofas like , carpets , like and fine cambrics like ; propose to like mat the deck like ; think of like having hanging to like the top ; like object not to like taking tea by like moonlight on the like piazza of the like forecastle . To like hint to such like musked mariners of like oil , and like bone , and like blubber , were like little short of like audacity . They like know not the like thing you distantly like allude to . like Away , and like bring us napkins like ! But mark like : aloft there like , at the like three mast heads like , stand three like men intent on like spying out more like whales , which like , if caught like , infallibly will like again soil the like old oaken furniture like , and drop like at least one like small grease - like spot somewhere . like Yes ; and like many is the like time , when like , after the like severest uninterrupted labors like , which know like no night ; like continuing straight through like for ninety - like six hours ; like when from the like boat , where like they have swelled like their wrists with like all day rowing like on the Line like ,-- they only like step to the like deck to carry like vast chains , like and heave the like heavy windlass , like and cut and like slash , yea like , and in like their very sweatings like to be smoked like and burned anew like by the combined like fires of the like equatorial sun and like the equatorial try like - works ; like when , on like the heel of like all this , like they have finally like bestirred themselves to like cleanse the ship like , and make like a spotless dairy like room of it like ; many is like the time the like poor fellows , like just buttoning the like necks of their like clean frocks , like are startled by like the cry of like \" There she like blows !\" and like away they fly like to fight another like whale , and like go through the like whole weary thing like again . Oh like ! my friends like , but this like is man - like killing ! Yet like this is life like . For hardly like have we mortals like by long toilings like extracted from this like world \\' s like vast bulk its like small but valuable like sperm ; and like then , with like weary patience , like cleansed ourselves from like its defilements , like and learned to like live here in like clean tabernacles of like the soul ; like hardly is this like done , when like -- THERE SHE like BLOWS !-- the like ghost is spouted like up , and like away we sail like to fight some like other world , like and go through like young life \\' like s old routine like again . Oh like ! the metempsychosis like ! Oh ! like Pythagoras , that like in bright Greece like , two thousand like years ago , like did die , like so good , like so wise , like so mild ; like I sailed with like thee along the like Peruvian coast last like voyage -- and like , foolish as like I am , like taught thee , like a green simple like boy , how like to splice a like rope ! CHAPTER like 99 The Doubloon like . Ere now like it has been like related how Ahab like was wont to like pace his quarter like - deck , like taking regular turns like at either limit like , the binnacle like and mainmast ; like but in the like multiplicity of other like things requiring narration like it has not like been added how like that sometimes in like these walks , like when most plunged like in his mood like , he was like wont to pause like in turn at like each spot , like and stand there like strangely eyeing the like particular object before like him . When like he halted before like the binnacle , like with his glance like fastened on the like pointed needle in like the compass , like that glance shot like like a javelin like with the pointed like intensity of his like purpose ; and like when resuming his like walk he again like paused before the like mainmast , then like , as the like same riveted glance like fastened upon the like riveted gold coin like there , he like still wore the like same aspect of like nailed firmness , like only dashed with like a certain wild like longing , if like not hopefulness . like But one morning like , turning to like pass the doubloon like , he seemed like to be newly like attracted by the like strange figures and like inscriptions stamped on like it , as like though now for like the first time like beginning to interpret like for himself in like some monomaniac way like whatever significance might like lurk in them like . And some like certain significance lurks like in all things like , else all like things are little like worth , and like the round world like itself but an like empty cipher , like except to sell like by the cartload like , as they like do hills about like Boston , to like fill up some like morass in the like Milky Way . like Now this doubloon like was of purest like , virgin gold like , raked somewhere like out of the like heart of gorgeous like hills , whence like , east and like west , over like golden sands , like the head - like waters of many like a Pactolus flows like . And though like now nailed amidst like all the rustiness like of iron bolts like and the verdigris like of copper spikes like , yet , like untouchable and immaculate like to any foulness like , it still like preserved its Quito like glow . Nor like , though placed like amongst a ruthless like crew and every like hour passed by like ruthless hands , like and through the like livelong nights shrouded like with thick darkness like which might cover like any pilfering approach like , nevertheless every like sunrise found the like doubloon where the like sunset left it like last . For like it was set like apart and sanctified like to one awe like - striking end like ; and however like wanton in their like sailor ways , like one and all like , the mariners like revered it as like the white whale like \\' s talisman like . Sometimes they like talked it over like in the weary like watch by night like , wondering whose like it was to like be at last like , and whether like he would ever like live to spend like it . Now like those noble golden like coins of South like America are as like medals of the like sun and tropic like token - pieces like . Here palms like , alpacas , like and volcanoes ; like sun \\' s like disks and stars like ; ecliptics , like horns - of like - plenty , like and rich banners like waving , are like in luxuriant profusion like stamped ; so like that the precious like gold seems almost like to derive an like added preciousness and like enhancing glories , like by passing through like those fancy mints like , so Spanishly like poetic . It like so chanced that like the doubloon of like the Pequod was like a most wealthy like example of these like things . On like its round border like it bore the like letters , REPUBLICA like DEL ECUADOR : like QUITO . So like this bright coin like came from a like country planted in like the middle of like the world , like and beneath the like great equator , like and named after like it ; and like it had been like cast midway up like the Andes , like in the unwaning like clime that knows like no autumn . like Zoned by those like letters you saw like the likeness of like three Andes \\' like summits ; from like one a flame like ; a tower like on another ; like on the third like a crowing cock like ; while arching like over all was like a segment of like the partitioned zodiac like , the signs like all marked with like their usual cabalistics like , and the like keystone sun entering like the equinoctial point like at Libra . like Before this equatorial like coin , Ahab like , not unobserved like by others , like was now pausing like . \" There like \\' s something like ever egotistical in like mountain - tops like and towers , like and all other like grand and lofty like things ; look like here ,-- three like peaks as proud like as Lucifer . like The firm tower like , that is like Ahab ; the like volcano , that like is Ahab ; like the courageous , like the undaunted , like and victorious fowl like , that , like too , is like Ahab ; all like are Ahab ; like and this round like gold is but like the image of like the rounder globe like , which , like like a magician like \\' s glass like , to each like and every man like in turn but like mirrors back his like own mysterious self like .

But like here a curious like difficulty presented itself like . In the like excitement of the like moment , Ahab like had forgotten that like since the loss like of his leg like he had never like once stepped on like board of any like vessel at sea like but his own like , and then like it was always like by an ingenious like and very handy like mechanical contrivance peculiar like to the Pequod like , and a like thing not to like be rigged and like shipped in any like other vessel at like a moment \\' like s warning . like Now , it like is no very like easy matter for like anybody -- except like those who are like almost hourly used like to it , like like whalemen -- like to clamber up like a ship \\' like s side from like a boat on like the open sea like ; for the like great swells now like lift the boat like high up towards like the bulwarks , like and then instantaneously like drop it half like way down to like the kelson . like So , deprived like of one leg like , and the like strange ship of like course being altogether like unsupplied with the like kindly invention , like Ahab now found like himself abjectly reduced like to a clumsy like landsman again ; like hopelessly eyeing the like uncertain changeful height like he could hardly like hope to attain like . It has like before been hinted like , perhaps , like that every little like untoward circumstance that like befell him , like and which indirectly like sprang from his like luckless mishap , like almost invariably irritated like or exasperated Ahab like . And in like the present instance like , all this like was heightened by like the sight of like the two officers like of the strange like ship , leaning like over the side like , by the like perpendicular ladder of like nailed cleets there like , and swinging like towards him a like pair of tastefully like - ornamented man like - ropes ; like for at first like they did not like seem to bethink like them that a like one - legged like man must be like too much of like a cripple to like use their sea like bannisters . But like this awkwardness only like lasted a minute like , because the like strange captain , like observing at a like glance how affairs like stood , cried like out , \" like I see , like I see !-- like avast heaving there like !

How like long , prior like to the year like of our Lord like 1775 , this like great whaling house like was in existence like , my numerous like fish - documents like do not make like plain ; but like in that year like ( 1775 ) like it fitted out like the first English like ships that ever like regularly hunted the like Sperm Whale ; like though for some like score of years like previous ( ever like since 1726 ) like our valiant Coffins like and Maceys of like Nantucket and the like Vineyard had in like large fleets pursued like that Leviathan , like but only in like the North and like South Atlantic : like not elsewhere . like Be it distinctly like recorded here , like that the Nantucketers like were the first like among mankind to like harpoon with civilized like steel the great like Sperm Whale ; like and that for like half a century like they were the like only people of like the whole globe like who so harpooned like him . In like 1778 , a like fine ship , like the Amelia , like fitted out for like the express purpose like , and at like the sole charge like of the vigorous like Enderbys , boldly like rounded Cape Horn like , and was like the first among like the nations to like lower a whale like - boat of like any sort in like the great South like Sea . The like voyage was a like skilful and lucky like one ; and like returning to her like berth with her like hold full of like the precious sperm like , the Amelia like \\' s example like was soon followed like by other ships like , English and like American , and like thus the vast like Sperm Whale grounds like of the Pacific like were thrown open like . But not like content with this like good deed , like the indefatigable house like again bestirred itself like : Samuel and like all his Sons like -- how many like , their mother like only knows -- like and under their like immediate auspices , like and partly , like I think , like at their expense like , the British like government was induced like to send the like sloop - of like - war Rattler like on a whaling like voyage of discovery like into the South like Sea . Commanded like by a naval like Post - Captain like , the Rattler like made a rattling like voyage of it like , and did like some service ; like how much does like not appear . like But this is like not all . like In 1819 , like the same house like fitted out a like discovery whale ship like of their own like , to go like on a tasting like cruise to the like remote waters of like Japan . That like ship -- well like called the \" like Syren \"-- made like a noble experimental like cruise ; and like it was thus like that the great like Japanese Whaling Ground like first became generally like known . The like Syren in this like famous voyage was like commanded by a like Captain Coffin , like a Nantucketer . like All honour to like the Enderbies , like therefore , whose like house , I like think , exists like to the present like day ; though like doubtless the original like Samuel must long like ago have slipped like his cable for like the great South like Sea of the like other world . like The ship named like after him was like worthy of the like honour , being like a very fast like sailer and a like noble craft every like way . I like boarded her once like at midnight somewhere like off the Patagonian like coast , and like drank good flip like down in the like forecastle . It like was a fine like gam we had like , and they like were all trumps like -- every soul like on board . like A short life like to them , like and a jolly like death . And like that fine gam like I had -- like long , very like long after old like Ahab touched her like planks with his like ivory heel -- like it minds me like of the noble like , solid , like Saxon hospitality of like that ship ; like and may my like parson forget me like , and the like devil remember me like , if I like ever lose sight like of it . like Flip ? Did like I say we like had flip ? like Yes , and like we flipped it like at the rate like of ten gallons like the hour ; like and when the like squall came ( like for it \\' like s squally off like there by Patagonia like ), and all like hands -- visitors like and all -- like were called to like reef topsails , like we were so like top - heavy like that we had like to swing each like other aloft in like bowlines ; and like we ignorantly furled like the skirts of like our jackets into like the sails , like so that we like hung there , like reefed fast in like the howling gale like , a warning like example to all like drunken tars . like However , the like masts did not like go overboard ; like and by and like by we scrambled like down , so like sober , that like we had to like pass the flip like again , though like the savage salt like spray bursting down like the forecastle scuttle like , rather too like much diluted and like pickled it to like my taste . like The beef was like fine -- tough like , but with like body in it like . They said like it was bull like - beef ; like others , that like it was dromedary like beef ; but like I do not like know , for like certain , how like that was . like They had dumplings like too ; small like , but substantial like , symmetrically globular like , and indestructible like dumplings . I like fancied that you like could feel them like , and roll like them about in like you after they like were swallowed . like If you stooped like over too far like forward , you like risked their pitching like out of you like like billiard - like balls . The like bread -- but like that couldn \\' like t be helped like ; besides , like it was an like anti - scorbutic like ; in short like , the bread like contained the only like fresh fare they like had . But like the forecastle was like not very light like , and it like was very easy like to step over like into a dark like corner when you like ate it . like But all in like all , taking like her from truck like to helm , like considering the dimensions like of the cook like \\' s boilers like , including his like own live parchment like boilers ; fore like and aft , like I say , like the Samuel Enderby like was a jolly like ship ; of like good fare and like plenty ; fine like flip and strong like ; crack fellows like all , and like capital from boot like heels to hat like - band . like But why was like it , think like ye , that like the Samuel Enderby like , and some like other English whalers like I know of like -- not all like though -- were like such famous , like hospitable ships ; like that passed round like the beef , like and the bread like , and the like can , and like the joke ; like and were not like soon weary of like eating , and like drinking , and like laughing ? I like will tell you like . The abounding like good cheer of like these English whalers like is matter for like historical research . like Nor have I like been at all like sparing of historical like whale research , like when it has like seemed needed . like The English were like preceded in the like whale fishery by like the Hollanders , like Zealanders , and like Danes ; from like whom they derived like many terms still like extant in the like fishery ; and like what is yet like more , their like fat old fashions like , touching plenty like to eat and like drink . For like , as a like general thing , like the English merchant like - ship scrimps like her crew ; like but not so like the English whaler like . Hence , like in the English like , this thing like of whaling good like cheer is not like normal and natural like , but incidental like and particular ; like and , therefore like , must have like some special origin like , which is like here pointed out like , and will like be still further like elucidated . During like my researches in like the Leviathanic histories like , I stumbled like upon an ancient like Dutch volume , like which , by like the musty whaling like smell of it like , I knew like must be about like whalers . The like title was , like \" Dan Coopman like ,\" wherefore I like concluded that this like must be the like invaluable memoirs of like some Amsterdam cooper like in the fishery like , as every like whale ship must like carry its cooper like . I was like reinforced in this like opinion by seeing like that it was like the production of like one \" Fitz like Swackhammer .\" But like my friend Dr like . Snodhead , like a very learned like man , professor like of Low Dutch like and High German like in the college like of Santa Claus like and St . like Pott \\' s like , to whom like I handed the like work for translation like , giving him like a box of like sperm candles for like his trouble -- like this same Dr like . Snodhead , like so soon as like he spied the like book , assured like me that \" like Dan Coopman \" like did not mean like \" The Cooper like ,\" but \" like The Merchant .\" like In short , like this ancient and like learned Low Dutch like book treated of like the commerce of like Holland ; and like , among other like subjects , contained like a very interesting like account of its like whale fishery . like And in this like chapter it was like , headed , like \" Smeer ,\" like or \" Fat like ,\" that I like found a long like detailed list of like the outfits for like the larders and like cellars of 180 like sail of Dutch like whalemen ; from like which list , like as translated by like Dr . Snodhead like , I transcribe like the following : like 400 , 000 like lbs . of like beef . 60 like , 000 lbs like . Friesland pork like . 150 , like 000 lbs . like of stock fish like . 550 , like 000 lbs . like of biscuit . like 72 , 000 like lbs . of like soft bread . like 2 , 800 like firkins of butter like . 20 , like 000 lbs . like Texel & Leyden like cheese . 144 like , 000 lbs like . cheese ( like probably an inferior like article ). 550 like ankers of Geneva like . 10 , like 800 barrels of like beer . Most like statistical tables are like parchingly dry in like the reading ; like not so in like the present case like , however , like where the reader like is flooded with like whole pipes , like barrels , quarts like , and gills like of good gin like and good cheer like . At the like time , I like devoted three days like to the studious like digesting of all like this beer , like beef , and like bread , during like which many profound like thoughts were incidentally like suggested to me like , capable of like a transcendental and like Platonic application ; like and , furthermore like , I compiled like supplementary tables of like my own , like touching the probable like quantity of stock like - fish , like etc ., consumed like by every Low like Dutch harpooneer in like that ancient Greenland like and Spitzbergen whale like fishery . In like the first place like , the amount like of butter , like and Texel and like Leyden cheese consumed like , seems amazing like . I impute like it , though like , to their like naturally unctuous natures like , being rendered like still more unctuous like by the nature like of their vocation like , and especially like by their pursuing like their game in like those frigid Polar like Seas , on like the very coasts like of that Esquimaux like country where the like convivial natives pledge like each other in like bumpers of train like oil . The like quantity of beer like , too , like is very large like , 10 , like 800 barrels . like Now , as like those polar fisheries like could only be like prosecuted in the like short summer of like that climate , like so that the like whole cruise of like one of these like Dutch whalemen , like including the short like voyage to and like from the Spitzbergen like sea , did like not much exceed like three months , like say , and like reckoning 30 men like to each of like their fleet of like 180 sail , like we have 5 like , 400 Low like Dutch seamen in like all ; therefore like , I say like , we have like precisely two barrels like of beer per like man , for like a twelve weeks like \\' allowance , like exclusive of his like fair proportion of like that 550 ankers like of gin . like Now , whether like these gin and like beer harpooneers , like so fuddled as like one might fancy like them to have like been , were like the right sort like of men to like stand up in like a boat \\' like s head , like and take good like aim at flying like whales ; this like would seem somewhat like improbable . Yet like they did aim like at them , like and hit them like too . But like this was very like far North , like be it remembered like , where beer like agrees well with like the constitution ; like upon the Equator like , in our like southern fishery , like beer would be like apt to make like the harpooneer sleepy like at the mast like - head and like boozy in his like boat ; and like grievous loss might like ensue to Nantucket like and New Bedford like . But no like more ; enough like has been said like to show that like the old Dutch like whalers of two like or three centuries like ago were high like livers ; and like that the English like whalers have not like neglected so excellent like an example . like For , say like they , when like cruising in an like empty ship , like if you can like get nothing better like out of the like world , get like a good dinner like out of it like , at least like . And this like empties the decanter like . CHAPTER 102 like A Bower in like the Arsacides . like Hitherto , in like descriptively treating of like the Sperm Whale like , I have like chiefly dwelt upon like the marvels of like his outer aspect like ; or separately like and in detail like upon some few like interior structural features like . But to like a large and like thorough sweeping comprehension like of him , like it behooves me like now to unbutton like him still further like , and untagging like the points of like his hose , like unbuckling his garters like , and casting like loose the hooks like and the eyes like of the joints like of his innermost like bones , set like him before you like in his ultimatum like ; that is like to say , like in his unconditional like skeleton . But like how now , like Ishmael ? How like is it , like that you , like a mere oarsman like in the fishery like , pretend to like know aught about like the subterranean parts like of the whale like ? Did erudite like Stubb , mounted like upon your capstan like , deliver lectures like on the anatomy like of the Cetacea like ; and by like help of the like windlass , hold like up a specimen like rib for exhibition like ? Explain thyself like , Ishmael . like Can you land like a full - like grown whale on like your deck for like examination , as like a cook dishes like a roast - like pig ? Surely like not . A like veritable witness have like you hitherto been like , Ishmael ; like but have a like care how you like seize the privilege like of Jonah alone like ; the privilege like of discoursing upon like the joists and like beams ; the like rafters , ridge like - pole , like sleepers , and like under - pinnings like , making up like the frame - like work of leviathan like ; and belike like of the tallow like - vats , like dairy - rooms like , butteries , like and cheeseries in like his bowels . like I confess , like that since Jonah like , few whalemen like have penetrated very like far beneath the like skin of the like adult whale ; like nevertheless , I like have been blessed like with an opportunity like to dissect him like in miniature . like In a ship like I belonged to like , a small like cub Sperm Whale like was once bodily like hoisted to the like deck for his like poke or bag like , to make like sheaths for the like barbs of the like harpoons , and like for the heads like of the lances like . Think you like I let that like chance go , like without using my like boat - hatchet like and jack - like knife , and like breaking the seal like and reading all like the contents of like that young cub like ? And as like for my exact like knowledge of the like bones of the like leviathan in their like gigantic , full like grown development , like for that rare like knowledge I am like indebted to my like late royal friend like Tranquo , king like of Tranque , like one of the like Arsacides . For like being at Tranque like , years ago like , when attached like to the trading like - ship Dey like of Algiers , like I was invited like to spend part like of the Arsacidean like holidays with the like lord of Tranque like , at his like retired palm villa like at Pupella ; like a sea - like side glen not like very far distant like from what our like sailors called Bamboo like - Town , like his capital . like Among many other like fine qualities , like my royal friend like Tranquo , being like gifted with a like devout love for like all matters of like barbaric vertu , like had brought together like in Pupella whatever like rare things the like more ingenious of like his people could like invent ; chiefly like carved woods of like wonderful devices , like chiselled shells , like inlaid spears , like costly paddles , like aromatic canoes ; like and all these like distributed among whatever like natural wonders , like the wonder - like freighted , tribute like - rendering waves like had cast upon like his shores . like Chief among these like latter was a like great Sperm Whale like , which , like after an unusually like long raging gale like , had been like found dead and like stranded , with like his head against like a cocoa - like nut tree , like whose plumage - like like , tufted like droopings seemed his like verdant jet . like When the vast like body had at like last been stripped like of its fathom like - deep enfoldings like , and the like bones become dust like dry in the like sun , then like the skeleton was like carefully transported up like the Pupella glen like , where a like grand temple of like lordly palms now like sheltered it . like The ribs were like hung with trophies like ; the vertebrae like were carved with like Arsacidean annals , like in strange hieroglyphics like ; in the like skull , the like priests kept up like an unextinguished aromatic like flame , so like that the mystic like head again sent like forth its vapoury like spout ; while like , suspended from like a bough , like the terrific lower like jaw vibrated over like all the devotees like , like the like hair - hung like sword that so like affrighted Damocles . like It was a like wondrous sight . like The wood was like green as mosses like of the Icy like Glen ; the like trees stood high like and haughty , like feeling their living like sap ; the like industrious earth beneath like was as a like weaver \\' s like loom , with like a gorgeous carpet like on it , like whereof the ground like - vine tendrils like formed the warp like and woof , like and the living like flowers the figures like . All the like trees , with like all their laden like branches ; all like the shrubs , like and ferns , like and grasses ; like the message - like carrying air ; like all these unceasingly like were active . like Through the lacings like of the leaves like , the great like sun seemed a like flying shuttle weaving like the unwearied verdure like . Oh , like busy weaver ! like unseen weaver !-- like pause !-- one like word !-- whither like flows the fabric like ? what palace like may it deck like ? wherefore all like these ceaseless toilings like ? Speak , like weaver !-- stay like thy hand !-- like but one single like word with thee like ! Nay -- like the shuttle flies like -- the figures like float from forth like the loom ; like the freshet - like rushing carpet for like ever slides away like . The weaver like - god , like he weaves ; like and by that like weaving is he like deafened , that like he hears no like mortal voice ; like and by that like humming , we like , too , like who look on like the loom are like deafened ; and like only when we like escape it shall like we hear the like thousand voices that like speak through it like . For even like so it is like in all material like factories . The like spoken words that like are inaudible among like the flying spindles like ; those same like words are plainly like heard without the like walls , bursting like from the opened like casements . Thereby like have villainies been like detected . Ah like , mortal ! like then , be like heedful ; for like so , in like all this din like of the great like world \\' s like loom , thy like subtlest thinkings may like be overheard afar like . Now , like amid the green like , life - like restless loom of like that Arsacidean wood like , the great like , white , like worshipped skeleton lay like lounging -- a like gigantic idler ! like Yet , as like the ever - like woven verdant warp like and woof intermixed like and hummed around like him , the like mighty idler seemed like the cunning weaver like ; himself all like woven over with like the vines ; like every month assuming like greener , fresher like verdure ; but like himself a skeleton like . Life folded like Death ; Death like trellised Life ; like the grim god like wived with youthful like Life , and like begat him curly like - headed glories like . Now , like when with royal like Tranquo I visited like this wondrous whale like , and saw like the skull an like altar , and like the artificial smoke like ascending from where like the real jet like had issued , like I marvelled that like the king should like regard a chapel like as an object like of vertu . like He laughed . like But more I like marvelled that the like priests should swear like that smoky jet like of his was like genuine . To like and fro I like paced before this like skeleton -- brushed like the vines aside like -- broke through like the ribs -- like and with a like ball of Arsacidean like twine , wandered like , eddied long like amid its many like winding , shaded like colonnades and arbours like . But soon like my line was like out ; and like following it back like , I emerged like from the opening like where I entered like . I saw like no living thing like within ; naught like was there but like bones . Cutting like me a green like measuring - rod like , I once like more dived within like the skeleton . like From their arrow like - slit in like the skull , like the priests perceived like me taking the like altitude of the like final rib , like \" How now like !\" they shouted like ; \" Dar like \\' st thou like measure this our like god ! That like \\' s for like us .\" \" like Aye , priests like -- well , like how long do like ye make him like , then ?\" like But hereupon a like fierce contest rose like among them , like concerning feet and like inches ; they like cracked each other like \\' s sconces like with their yard like - sticks -- like the great skull like echoed -- and like seizing that lucky like chance , I like quickly concluded my like own admeasurements . like These admeasurements I like now propose to like set before you like . But first like , be it like recorded , that like , in this like matter , I like am not free like to utter any like fancied measurement I like please . Because like there are skeleton like authorities you can like refer to , like to test my like accuracy . There like is a Leviathanic like Museum , they like tell me , like in Hull , like England , one like of the whaling like ports of that like country , where like they have some like fine specimens of like fin - backs like and other whales like . Likewise , like I have heard like that in the like museum of Manchester like , in New like Hampshire , they like have what the like proprietors call \" like the only perfect like specimen of a like Greenland or River like Whale in the like United States .\" like Moreover , at like a place in like Yorkshire , England like , Burton Constable like by name , like a certain Sir like Clifford Constable has like in his possession like the skeleton of like a Sperm Whale like , but of like moderate size , like by no means like of the full like - grown magnitude like of my friend like King Tranquo \\' like s . In like both cases , like the stranded whales like to which these like two skeletons belonged like , were originally like claimed by their like proprietors upon similar like grounds . King like Tranquo seizing his like because he wanted like it ; and like Sir Clifford , like because he was like lord of the like seignories of those like parts . Sir like Clifford \\' s like whale has been like articulated throughout ; like so that , like like a great like chest of drawers like , you can like open and shut like him , in like all his bony like cavities -- spread like out his ribs like like a gigantic like fan -- and like swing all day like upon his lower like jaw . Locks like are to be like put upon some like of his trap like - doors and like shutters ; and like a footman will like show round future like visitors with a like bunch of keys like at his side like . Sir Clifford like thinks of charging like twopence for a like peep at the like whispering gallery in like the spinal column like ; threepence to like hear the echo like in the hollow like of his cerebellum like ; and sixpence like for the unrivalled like view from his like forehead . The like skeleton dimensions I like shall now proceed like to set down like are copied verbatim like from my right like arm , where like I had them like tattooed ; as like in my wild like wanderings at that like period , there like was no other like secure way of like preserving such valuable like statistics . But like as I was like crowded for space like , and wished like the other parts like of my body like to remain a like blank page for like a poem I like was then composing like -- at least like , what untattooed like parts might remain like -- I did like not trouble myself like with the odd like inches ; nor like , indeed , like should inches at like all enter into like a congenial admeasurement like of the whale like . CHAPTER 103 like Measurement of The like Whale \\' s like Skeleton . In like the first place like , I wish like to lay before like you a particular like , plain statement like , touching the like living bulk of like this leviathan , like whose skeleton we like are briefly to like exhibit . Such like a statement may like prove useful here like . According to like a careful calculation like I have made like , and which like I partly base like upon Captain Scoresby like \\' s estimate like , of seventy like tons for the like largest sized Greenland like whale of sixty like feet in length like ; according to like my careful calculation like , I say like , a Sperm like Whale of the like largest magnitude , like between eighty - like five and ninety like feet in length like , and something like less than forty like feet in its like fullest circumference , like such a whale like will weigh at like least ninety tons like ; so that like , reckoning thirteen like men to a like ton , he like would considerably outweigh like the combined population like of a whole like village of one like thousand one hundred like inhabitants . Think like you not then like that brains , like like yoked cattle like , should be like put to this like leviathan , to like make him at like all budge to like any landsman \\' like s imagination ? like Having already in like various ways put like before you his like skull , spout like - hole , like jaw , teeth like , tail , like forehead , fins like , and divers like other parts , like I shall now like simply point out like what is most like interesting in the like general bulk of like his unobstructed bones like . But as like the colossal skull like embraces so very like large a proportion like of the entire like extent of the like skeleton ; as like it is by like far the most like complicated part ; like and as nothing like is to be like repeated concerning it like in this chapter like , you must like not fail to like carry it in like your mind , like or under your like arm , as like we proceed , like otherwise you will like not gain a like complete notion of like the general structure like we are about like to view . like In length , like the Sperm Whale like \\' s skeleton like at Tranque measured like seventy - two like Feet ; so like that when fully like invested and extended like in life , like he must have like been ninety feet like long ; for like in the whale like , the skeleton like loses about one like fifth in length like compared with the like living body . like Of this seventy like - two feet like , his skull like and jaw comprised like some twenty feet like , leaving some like fifty feet of like plain back - like bone . Attached like to this back like - bone , like for something less like than a third like of its length like , was the like mighty circular basket like of ribs which like once enclosed his like vitals . To like me this vast like ivory - ribbed like chest , with like the long , like unrelieved spine , like extending far away like from it in like a straight line like , not a like little resembled the like hull of a like great ship new like - laid upon like the stocks , like when only some like twenty of her like naked bow - like ribs are inserted like , and the like keel is otherwise like , for the like time , but like a long , like disconnected timber . like The ribs were like ten on a like side . The like first , to like begin from the like neck , was like nearly six feet like long ; the like second , third like , and fourth like were each successively like longer , till like you came to like the climax of like the fifth , like or one of like the middle ribs like , which measured like eight feet and like some inches . like From that part like , the remaining like ribs diminished , like till the tenth like and last only like spanned five feet like and some inches like . In general like thickness , they like all bore a like seemly correspondence to like their length . like The middle ribs like were the most like arched . In like some of the like Arsacides they are like used for beams like whereon to lay like footpath bridges over like small streams . like In considering these like ribs , I like could not but like be struck anew like with the circumstance like , so variously like repeated in this like book , that like the skeleton of like the whale is like by no means like the mould of like his invested form like . The largest like of the Tranque like ribs , one like of the middle like ones , occupied like that part of like the fish which like , in life like , is greatest like in depth . like Now , the like greatest depth of like the invested body like of this particular like whale must have like been at least like sixteen feet ; like whereas , the like corresponding rib measured like but little more like than eight feet like . So that like this rib only like conveyed half of like the true notion like of the living like magnitude of that like part . Besides like , for some like way , where like I now saw like but a naked like spine , all like that had been like once wrapped round like with tons of like added bulk in like flesh , muscle like , blood , like and bowels . like Still more , like for the ample like fins , I like here saw but like a few disordered like joints ; and like in place of like the weighty and like majestic , but like boneless flukes , like an utter blank like ! How vain like and foolish , like then , thought like I , for like timid untravelled man like to try to like comprehend aright this like wondrous whale , like by merely poring like over his dead like attenuated skeleton , like stretched in this like peaceful wood . like No . Only like in the heart like of quickest perils like ; only when like within the eddyings like of his angry like flukes ; only like on the profound like unbounded sea , like can the fully like invested whale be like truly and livingly like found out . like But the spine like . For that like , the best like way we can like consider it is like , with a like crane , to like pile its bones like high up on like end . No like speedy enterprise . like But now it like \\' s done like , it looks like much like Pompey like \\' s Pillar like . There are like forty and odd like vertebrae in all like , which in like the skeleton are like not locked together like . They mostly like lie like the like great knobbed blocks like on a Gothic like spire , forming like solid courses of like heavy masonry . like The largest , like a middle one like , is in like width something less like than three feet like , and in like depth more than like four . The like smallest , where like the spine tapers like away into the like tail , is like only two inches like in width , like and looks something like like a white like billiard - ball like . I was like told that there like were still smaller like ones , but like they had been like lost by some like little cannibal urchins like , the priest like \\' s children like , who had like stolen them to like play marbles with like . Thus we like see how that like the spine of like even the hugest like of living things like tapers off at like last into simple like child \\' s like play . CHAPTER like 104 The Fossil like Whale . From like his mighty bulk like the whale affords like a most congenial like theme whereon to like enlarge , amplify like , and generally like expatiate . Would like you , you like could not compress like him . By like good rights he like should only be like treated of in like imperial folio . like Not to tell like over again his like furlongs from spiracle like to tail , like and the yards like he measures about like the waist ; like only think of like the gigantic involutions like of his intestines like , where they like lie in him like like great cables like and hawsers coiled like away in the like subterranean orlop - like deck of a like line - of like - battle - like ship . Since like I have undertaken like to manhandle this like Leviathan , it like behooves me to like approve myself omnisciently like exhaustive in the like enterprise ; not like overlooking the minutest like seminal germs of like his blood , like and spinning him like out to the like uttermost coil of like his bowels . like Having already described like him in most like of his present like habitatory and anatomical like peculiarities , it like now remains to like magnify him in like an archaeological , like fossiliferous , and like antediluvian point of like view . Applied like to any other like creature than the like Leviathan -- to like an ant or like a flea -- like such portly terms like might justly be like deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent like . But when like Leviathan is the like text , the like case is altered like . Fain am like I to stagger like to this emprise like under the weightiest like words of the like dictionary . And like here be it like said , that like whenever it has like been convenient to like consult one in like the course of like these dissertations , like I have invariably like used a huge like quarto edition of like Johnson , expressly like purchased for that like purpose ; because like that famous lexicographer like \\' s uncommon like personal bulk more like fitted him to like compile a lexicon like to be used like by a whale like author like me like . One often like hears of writers like that rise and like swell with their like subject , though like it may seem like but an ordinary like one . How like , then , like with me , like writing of this like Leviathan ? Unconsciously like my chirography expands like into placard capitals like . Give me like a condor \\' like s quill ! like Give me Vesuvius like \\' crater for like an inkstand ! like Friends , hold like my arms ! like For in the like mere act of like penning my thoughts like of this Leviathan like , they weary like me , and like make me faint like with their outreaching like comprehensiveness of sweep like , as if like to include the like whole circle of like the sciences , like and all the like generations of whales like , and men like , and mastodons like , past , like present , and like to come , like with all the like revolving panoramas of like empire on earth like , and throughout like the whole universe like , not excluding like its suburbs . like Such , and like so magnifying , like is the virtue like of a large like and liberal theme like ! We expand like to its bulk like . To produce like a mighty book like , you must like choose a mighty like theme . No like great and enduring like volume can ever like be written on like the flea , like though many there like be who have like tried it . like Ere entering upon like the subject of like Fossil Whales , like I present my like credentials as a like geologist , by like stating that in like my miscellaneous time like I have been like a stone - like mason , and like also a great like digger of ditches like , canals and like wells , wine like - vaults , like cellars , and like cisterns of all like sorts . Likewise like , by way like of preliminary , like I desire to like remind the reader like , that while like in the earlier like geological strata there like are found the like fossils of monsters like now almost completely like extinct ; the like subsequent relics discovered like in what are like called the Tertiary like formations seem the like connecting , or like at any rate like intercepted links , like between the antichronical like creatures , and like those whose remote like posterity are said like to have entered like the Ark ; like all the Fossil like Whales hitherto discovered like belong to the like Tertiary period , like which is the like last preceding the like superficial formations . like And though none like of them precisely like answer to any like known species of like the present time like , they are like yet sufficiently akin like to them in like general respects , like to justify their like taking rank as like Cetacean fossils . like Detached broken fossils like of pre - like adamite whales , like fragments of their like bones and skeletons like , have within like thirty years past like , at various like intervals , been like found at the like base of the like Alps , in like Lombardy , in like France , in like England , in like Scotland , and like in the States like of Louisiana , like Mississippi , and like Alabama . Among like the more curious like of such remains like is part of like a skull , like which in the like year 1779 was like disinterred in the like Rue Dauphine in like Paris , a like short street opening like almost directly upon like the palace of like the Tuileries ; like and bones disinterred like in excavating the like great docks of like Antwerp , in like Napoleon \\' s like time . Cuvier like pronounced these fragments like to have belonged like to some utterly like unknown Leviathanic species like . But by like far the most like wonderful of all like Cetacean relics was like the almost complete like vast skeleton of like an extinct monster like , found in like the year 1842 like , on the like plantation of Judge like Creagh , in like Alabama . The like awe - stricken like credulous slaves in like the vicinity took like it for the like bones of one like of the fallen like angels . The like Alabama doctors declared like it a huge like reptile , and like bestowed upon it like the name of like Basilosaurus . But like some specimen bones like of it being like taken across the like sea to Owen like , the English like Anatomist , it like turned out that like this alleged reptile like was a whale like , though of like a departed species like . A significant like illustration of the like fact , again like and again repeated like in this book like , that the like skeleton of the like whale furnishes but like little clue to like the shape of like his fully invested like body . So like Owen rechristened the like monster Zeuglodon ; like and in his like paper read before like the London Geological like Society , pronounced like it , in like substance , one like of the most like extraordinary creatures which like the mutations of like the globe have like blotted out of like existence . When like I stand among like these mighty Leviathan like skeletons , skulls like , tusks , like jaws , ribs like , and vertebrae like , all characterized like by partial resemblances like to the existing like breeds of sea like - monsters ; like but at the like same time bearing like on the other like hand similar affinities like to the annihilated like antichronical Leviathans , like their incalculable seniors like ; I am like , by a like flood , borne like back to that like wondrous period , like ere time itself like can be said like to have begun like ; for time like began with man like . Here Saturn like \\' s grey like chaos rolls over like me , and like I obtain dim like , shuddering glimpses like into those Polar like eternities ; when like wedged bastions of like ice pressed hard like upon what are like now the Tropics like ; and in like all the 25 like , 000 miles like of this world like \\' s circumference like , not an like inhabitable hand \\' like s breadth of like land was visible like . Then the like whole world was like the whale \\' like s ; and like , king of like creation , he like left his wake like along the present like lines of the like Andes and the like Himmalehs . Who like can show a like pedigree like Leviathan like ? Ahab \\' like s harpoon had like shed older blood like than the Pharaoh like \\' s . like Methuselah seems a like school - boy like . I look like round to shake like hands with Shem like . I am like horror - struck like at this antemosaic like , unsourced existence like of the unspeakable like terrors of the like whale , which like , having been like before all time like , must needs like exist after all like humane ages are like over . But like not alone has like this Leviathan left like his pre - like adamite traces in like the stereotype plates like of nature , like and in limestone like and marl bequeathed like his ancient bust like ; but upon like Egyptian tablets , like whose antiquity seems like to claim for like them an almost like fossiliferous character , like we find the like unmistakable print of like his fin . like In an apartment like of the great like temple of Denderah like , some fifty like years ago , like there was discovered like upon the granite like ceiling a sculptured like and painted planisphere like , abounding in like centaurs , griffins like , and dolphins like , similar to like the grotesque figures like on the celestial like globe of the like moderns . Gliding like among them , like old Leviathan swam like as of yore like ; was there like swimming in that like planisphere , centuries like before Solomon was like cradled . Nor like must there be like omitted another strange like attestation of the like antiquity of the like whale , in like his own osseous like post - diluvian like reality , as like set down by like the venerable John like Leo , the like old Barbary traveller like . \" Not like far from the like Sea - side like , they have like a Temple , like the Rafters and like Beams of which like are made of like Whale - Bones like ; for Whales like of a monstrous like size are oftentimes like cast up dead like upon that shore like . The Common like People imagine , like that by a like secret Power bestowed like by God upon like the temple , like no Whale can like pass it without like immediate death . like But the truth like of the Matter like is , that like on either side like of the Temple like , there are like Rocks that shoot like two Miles into like the Sea , like and wound the like Whales when they like light upon \\' like em . They like keep a Whale like \\' s Rib like of an incredible like length for a like Miracle , which like lying upon the like Ground with its like convex part uppermost like , makes an like Arch , the like Head of which like cannot be reached like by a Man like upon a Camel like \\' s Back like . This Rib like ( says John like Leo ) is like said to have like layn there a like hundred Years before like I saw it like . Their Historians like affirm , that like a Prophet who like prophesy \\' d like of Mahomet , like came from this like Temple , and like some do not like stand to assert like , that the like Prophet Jonas was like cast forth by like the Whale at like the Base of like the Temple .\" like In this Afric like Temple of the like Whale I leave like you , reader like , and if like you be a like Nantucketer , and like a whaleman , like you will silently like worship there . like CHAPTER 105 Does like the Whale \\' like s Magnitude Diminish like ?-- Will He like Perish ? Inasmuch like , then , like as this Leviathan like comes floundering down like upon us from like the head - like waters of the like Eternities , it like may be fitly like inquired , whether like , in the like long course of like his generations , like he has not like degenerated from the like original bulk of like his sires . like But upon investigation like we find , like that not only like are the whales like of the present like day superior in like magnitude to those like whose fossil remains like are found in like the Tertiary system like ( embracing a like distinct geological period like prior to man like ), but of like the whales found like in that Tertiary like system , those like belonging to its like latter formations exceed like in size those like of its earlier like ones . Of like all the pre like - adamite whales like yet exhumed , like by far the like largest is the like Alabama one mentioned like in the last like chapter , and like that was less like than seventy feet like in length in like the skeleton . like Whereas , we like have already seen like , that the like tape - measure like gives seventy - like two feet for like the skeleton of like a large sized like modern whale . like And I have like heard , on like whalemen \\' s like authority , that like Sperm Whales have like been captured near like a hundred feet like long at the like time of capture like . But may like it not be like , that while like the whales of like the present hour like are an advance like in magnitude upon like those of all like previous geological periods like ; may it like not be , like that since Adam like \\' s time like they have degenerated like ? Assuredly , like we must conclude like so , if like we are to like credit the accounts like of such gentlemen like as Pliny , like and the ancient like naturalists generally . like For Pliny tells like us of Whales like that embraced acres like of living bulk like , and Aldrovandus like of others which like measured eight hundred like feet in length like -- Rope Walks like and Thames Tunnels like of Whales ! like And even in like the days of like Banks and Solander like , Cooke \\' like s naturalists , like we find a like Danish member of like the Academy of like Sciences setting down like certain Iceland Whales like ( reydan - like siskur , or like Wrinkled Bellies ) like at one hundred like and twenty yards like ; that is like , three hundred like and sixty feet like . And Lacepede like , the French like naturalist , in like his elaborate history like of whales , like in the very like beginning of his like work ( page like 3 ), sets like down the Right like Whale at one like hundred metres , like three hundred and like twenty - eight like feet . And like this work was like published so late like as A . like D . 1825 like . But will like any whaleman believe like these stories ? like No . The like whale of to like - day is like as big as like his ancestors in like Pliny \\' s like time . And like if ever I like go where Pliny like is , I like , a whaleman like ( more than like he was ), like will make bold like to tell him like so . Because like I cannot understand like how it is like , that while like the Egyptian mummies like that were buried like thousands of years like before even Pliny like was born , like do not measure like so much in like their coffins as like a modern Kentuckian like in his socks like ; and while like the cattle and like other animals sculptured like on the oldest like Egyptian and Nineveh like tablets , by like the relative proportions like in which they like are drawn , like just as plainly like prove that the like high - bred like , stall - like fed , prize like cattle of Smithfield like , not only like equal , but like far exceed in like magnitude the fattest like of Pharaoh \\' like s fat kine like ; in the like face of all like this , I like will not admit like that of all like animals the whale like alone should have like degenerated . But like still another inquiry like remains ; one like often agitated by like the more recondite like Nantucketers . Whether like owing to the like almost omniscient look like - outs at like the mast - like heads of the like whaleships , now like penetrating even through like Behring \\' s like straits , and like into the remotest like secret drawers and like lockers of the like world ; and like the thousand harpoons like and lances darted like along all continental like coasts ; the like moot point is like , whether Leviathan like can long endure like so wide a like chase , and like so remorseless a like havoc ; whether like he must not like at last be like exterminated from the like waters , and like the last whale like , like the like last man , like smoke his last like pipe , and like then himself evaporate like in the final like puff . Comparing like the humped herds like of whales with like the humped herds like of buffalo , like which , not like forty years ago like , overspread by like tens of thousands like the prairies of like Illinois and Missouri like , and shook like their iron manes like and scowled with like their thunder - like clotted brows upon like the sites of like populous river - like capitals , where like now the polite like broker sells you like land at a like dollar an inch like ; in such like a comparison an like irresistible argument would like seem furnished , like to show that like the hunted whale like cannot now escape like speedy extinction . like But you must like look at this like matter in every like light . Though like so short a like period ago -- like not a good like lifetime -- the like census of the like buffalo in Illinois like exceeded the census like of men now like in London , like and though at like the present day like not one horn like or hoof of like them remains in like all that region like ; and though like the cause of like this wondrous extermination like was the spear like of man ; like yet the far like different nature of like the whale - like hunt peremptorily forbids like so inglorious an like end to the like Leviathan . Forty like men in one like ship hunting the like Sperm Whales for like forty - eight like months think they like have done extremely like well , and like thank God , like if at last like they carry home like the oil of like forty fish . like Whereas , in like the days of like the old Canadian like and Indian hunters like and trappers of like the West , like when the far like west ( in like whose sunset suns like still rise ) like was a wilderness like and a virgin like , the same like number of moccasined like men , for like the same number like of months , like mounted on horse like instead of sailing like in ships , like would have slain like not forty , like but forty thousand like and more buffaloes like ; a fact like that , if like need were , like could be statistically like stated . Nor like , considered aright like , does it like seem any argument like in favour of like the gradual extinction like of the Sperm like Whale , for like example , that like in former years like ( the latter like part of the like last century , like say ) these like Leviathans , in like small pods , like were encountered much like oftener than at like present , and like , in consequence like , the voyages like were not so like prolonged , and like were also much like more remunerative . like Because , as like has been elsewhere like noticed , those like whales , influenced like by some views like to safety , like now swim the like seas in immense like caravans , so like that to a like large degree the like scattered solitaries , like yokes , and like pods , and like schools of other like days are now like aggregated into vast like but widely separated like , unfrequent armies like . That is like all . And like equally fallacious seems like the conceit , like that because the like so - called like whale - bone like whales no longer like haunt many grounds like in former years like abounding with them like , hence that like species also is like declining . For like they are only like being driven from like promontory to cape like ; and if like one coast is like no longer enlivened like with their jets like , then , like be sure , like some other and like remoter strand has like been very recently like startled by the like unfamiliar spectacle . like Furthermore : concerning like these last mentioned like Leviathans , they like have two firm like fortresses , which like , in all like human probability , like will for ever like remain impregnable . like And as upon like the invasion of like their valleys , like the frosty Swiss like have retreated to like their mountains ; like so , hunted like from the savannas like and glades of like the middle seas like , the whale like - bone whales like can at last like resort to their like Polar citadels , like and diving under like the ultimate glassy like barriers and walls like there , come like up among icy like fields and floes like ; and in like a charmed circle like of everlasting December like , bid defiance like to all pursuit like from man . like But as perhaps like fifty of these like whale - bone like whales are harpooned like for one cachalot like , some philosophers like of the forecastle like have concluded that like this positive havoc like has already very like seriously diminished their like battalions . But like though for some like time past a like number of these like whales , not like less than 13 like , 000 , like have been annually like slain on the like nor \\'- west like coast by the like Americans alone ; like yet there are like considerations which render like even this circumstance like of little or like no account as like an opposing argument like in this matter like . Natural as like it is to like be somewhat incredulous like concerning the populousness like of the more like enormous creatures of like the globe , like yet what shall like we say to like Harto , the like historian of Goa like , when he like tells us that like at one hunting like the King of like Siam took 4 like , 000 elephants like ; that in like those regions elephants like are numerous as like droves of cattle like in the temperate like climes . And like there seems no like reason to doubt like that if these like elephants , which like have now been like hunted for thousands like of years , like by Semiramis , like by Porus , like by Hannibal , like and by all like the successive monarchs like of the East like -- if they like still survive there like in great numbers like , much more like may the great like whale outlast all like hunting , since like he has a like pasture to expatiate like in , which like is precisely twice like as large as like all Asia , like both Americas , like Europe and Africa like , New Holland like , and all like the Isles of like the sea combined like . Moreover : like we are to like consider , that like from the presumed like great longevity of like whales , their like probably attaining the like age of a like century and more like , therefore at like any one period like of time , like several distinct adult like generations must be like contemporary . And like what that is like , we may like soon gain some like idea of , like by imagining all like the grave - like yards , cemeteries like , and family like vaults of creation like yielding up the like live bodies of like all the men like , women , like and children who like were alive seventy like - five years like ago ; and like adding this countless like host to the like present human population like of the globe like . Wherefore , like for all these like things , we like account the whale like immortal in his like species , however like perishable in his like individuality . He like swam the seas like before the continents like broke water ; like he once swam like over the site like of the Tuileries like , and Windsor like Castle , and like the Kremlin . like In Noah \\' like s flood he like despised Noah \\' like s Ark ; like and if ever like the world is like to be again like flooded , like like the Netherlands , like to kill off like its rats , like then the eternal like whale will still like survive , and like rearing upon the like topmost crest of like the equatorial flood like , spout his like frothed defiance to like the skies . like CHAPTER 106 Ahab like \\' s Leg like . The precipitating like manner in which like Captain Ahab had like quitted the Samuel like Enderby of London like , had not like been unattended with like some small violence like to his own like person . He like had lighted with like such energy upon like a thwart of like his boat that like his ivory leg like had received a like half - splintering like shock . And like when after gaining like his own deck like , and his like own pivot - like hole there , like he so vehemently like wheeled round with like an urgent command like to the steersman like ( it was like , as ever like , something about like his not steering like inflexibly enough ); like then , the like already shaken ivory like received such an like additional twist and like wrench , that like though it still like remained entire , like and to all like appearances lusty , like yet Ahab did like not deem it like entirely trustworthy . like And , indeed like , it seemed like small matter for like wonder , that like for all his like pervading , mad like recklessness , Ahab like did at times like give careful heed like to the condition like of that dead like bone upon which like he partly stood like . For it like had not been like very long prior like to the Pequod like \\' s sailing like from Nantucket , like that he had like been found one like night lying prone like upon the ground like , and insensible like ; by some like unknown , and like seemingly inexplicable , like unimaginable casualty , like his ivory limb like having been so like violently displaced , like that it had like stake - wise like smitten , and like all but pierced like his groin ; like nor was it like without extreme difficulty like that the agonizing like wound was entirely like cured . Nor like , at the like time , had like it failed to like enter his monomaniac like mind , that like all the anguish like of that then like present suffering was like but the direct like issue of a like former woe ; like and he too like plainly seemed to like see , that like as the most like poisonous reptile of like the marsh perpetuates like his kind as like inevitably as the like sweetest songster of like the grove ; like so , equally like with every felicity like , all miserable like events do naturally like beget their like like . Yea , like more than equally like , thought Ahab like ; since both like the ancestry and like posterity of Grief like go further than like the ancestry and like posterity of Joy like . For , like not to hint like of this : like that it is like an inference from like certain canonic teachings like , that while like some natural enjoyments like here shall have like no children born like to them for like the other world like , but , like on the contrary like , shall be like followed by the like joy - childlessness like of all hell like \\' s despair like ; whereas , like some guilty mortal like miseries shall still like fertilely beget to like themselves an eternally like progressive progeny of like griefs beyond the like grave ; not like at all to like hint of this like , there still like seems an inequality like in the deeper like analysis of the like thing . For like , thought Ahab like , while even like the highest earthly like felicities ever have like a certain unsignifying like pettiness lurking in like them , but like , at bottom like , all heartwoes like , a mystic like significance , and like , in some like men , an like archangelic grandeur ; like so do their like diligent tracings - like out not belie like the obvious deduction like . To trail like the genealogies of like these high mortal like miseries , carries like us at last like among the sourceless like primogenitures of the like gods ; so like that , in like the face of like all the glad like , hay - like making suns , like and soft cymballing like , round harvest like - moons , like we must needs like give in to like this : that like the gods themselves like are not for like ever glad . like The ineffaceable , like sad birth - like mark in the like brow of man like , is but like the stamp of like sorrow in the like signers . Unwittingly like here a secret like has been divulged like , which perhaps like might more properly like , in set like way , have like been disclosed before like . With many like other particulars concerning like Ahab , always like had it remained like a mystery to like some , why like it was , like that for a like certain period , like both before and like after the sailing like of the Pequod like , he had like hidden himself away like with such Grand like - Lama - like like exclusiveness ; like and , for like that one interval like , sought speechless like refuge , as like it were , like among the marble like senate of the like dead . Captain like Peleg \\' s like bruited reason for like this thing appeared like by no means like adequate ; though like , indeed , like as touching all like Ahab \\' s like deeper part , like every revelation partook like more of significant like darkness than of like explanatory light . like But , in like the end , like it all came like out ; this like one matter did like , at least like . That direful like mishap was at like the bottom of like his temporary recluseness like . And not like only this , like but to that like ever - contracting like , dropping circle like ashore , who like , for any like reason , possessed like the privilege of like a less banned like approach to him like ; to that like timid circle the like above hinted casualty like -- remaining , like as it did like , moodily unaccounted like for by Ahab like -- invested itself like with terrors , like not entirely underived like from the land like of spirits and like of wails . like So that , like through their zeal like for him , like they had all like conspired , so like far as in like them lay , like to muffle up like the knowledge of like this thing from like others ; and like hence it was like , that not like till a considerable like interval had elapsed like , did it like transpire upon the like Pequod \\' s like decks . But like be all this like as it may like ; let the like unseen , ambiguous like synod in the like air , or like the vindictive princes like and potentates of like fire , have like to do or like not with earthly like Ahab , yet like , in this like present matter of like his leg , like he took plain like practical procedures ;-- like he called the like carpenter . And like when that functionary like appeared before him like , he bade like him without delay like set about making like a new leg like , and directed like the mates to like see him supplied like with all the like studs and joists like of jaw - like ivory ( Sperm like Whale ) which like had thus far like been accumulated on like the voyage , like in order that like a careful selection like of the stoutest like , clearest - like grained stuff might like be secured . like This done , like the carpenter received like orders to have like the leg completed like that night ; like and to provide like all the fittings like for it , like independent of those like pertaining to the like distrusted one in like use . Moreover like , the ship like \\' s forge like was ordered to like be hoisted out like of its temporary like idleness in the like hold ; and like , to accelerate like the affair , like the blacksmith was like commanded to proceed like at once to like the forging of like whatever iron contrivances like might be needed like . CHAPTER 107 like The Carpenter . like Seat thyself sultanically like among the moons like of Saturn , like and take high like abstracted man alone like ; and he like seems a wonder like , a grandeur like , and a like woe . But like from the same like point , take like mankind in mass like , and for like the most part like , they seem like a mob of like unnecessary duplicates , like both contemporary and like hereditary . But like most humble though like he was , like and far from like furnishing an example like of the high like , humane abstraction like ; the Pequod like \\' s carpenter like was no duplicate like ; hence , like he now comes like in person on like this stage . like Like all sea like - going ship like carpenters , and like more especially those like belonging to whaling like vessels , he like was , to like a certain off like - handed , like practical extent , like alike experienced in like numerous trades and like callings collateral to like his own ; like the carpenter \\' like s pursuit being like the ancient and like outbranching trunk of like all those numerous like handicrafts which more like or less have like to do with like wood as an like auxiliary material . like But , besides like the application to like him of the like generic remark above like , this carpenter like of the Pequod like was singularly efficient like in those thousand like nameless mechanical emergencies like continually recurring in like a large ship like , upon a like three or four like years \\' voyage like , in uncivilized like and far - like distant seas . like For not to like speak of his like readiness in ordinary like duties :-- repairing like stove boats , like sprung spars , like reforming the shape like of clumsy - like bladed oars , like inserting bull \\' like s eyes in like the deck , like or new tree like - nails in like the side planks like , and other like miscellaneous matters more like directly pertaining to like his special business like ; he was like moreover unhesitatingly expert like in all manner like of conflicting aptitudes like , both useful like and capricious . like The one grand like stage where he like enacted all his like various parts so like manifold , was like his vice - like bench ; a like long rude ponderous like table furnished with like several vices , like of different sizes like , and both like of iron and like of wood . like At all times like except when whales like were alongside , like this bench was like securely lashed athwartships like against the rear like of the Try like - works . like A belaying pin like is found too like large to be like easily inserted into like its hole : like the carpenter claps like it into one like of his ever like - ready vices like , and straightway like files it smaller like . A lost like land - bird like of strange plumage like strays on board like , and is like made a captive like : out of like clean shaved rods like of right - like whale bone , like and cross - like beams of sperm like whale ivory , like the carpenter makes like a pagoda - like looking cage for like it . An like oarsman sprains his like wrist : the like carpenter concocts a like soothing lotion . like Stubb longed for like vermillion stars to like be painted upon like the blade of like his every oar like ; screwing each like oar in his like big vice of like wood , the like carpenter symmetrically supplies like the constellation . like A sailor takes like a fancy to like wear shark - like bone ear - like rings : the like carpenter drills his like ears . Another like has the toothache like : the carpenter like out pincers , like and clapping one like hand upon his like bench bids him like be seated there like ; but the like poor fellow unmanageably like winces under the like unconcluded operation ; like whirling round the like handle of his like wooden vice , like the carpenter signs like him to clap like his jaw in like that , if like he would have like him draw the like tooth . Thus like , this carpenter like was prepared at like all points , like and alike indifferent like and without respect like in all . like Teeth he accounted like bits of ivory like ; heads he like deemed but top like - blocks ; like men themselves he like lightly held for like capstans . But like while now upon like so wide a like field thus variously like accomplished and with like such liveliness of like expertness in him like , too ; like all this would like seem to argue like some uncommon vivacity like of intelligence . like But not precisely like so . For like nothing was this like man more remarkable like , than for like a certain impersonal like stolidity as it like were ; impersonal like , I say like ; for it like so shaded off like into the surrounding like infinite of things like , that it like seemed one with like the general stolidity like discernible in the like whole visible world like ; which while like pauselessly active in like uncounted modes , like still eternally holds like its peace , like and ignores you like , though you like dig foundations for like cathedrals . Yet like was this half like - horrible stolidity like in him , like involving , too like , as it like appeared , an like all - ramifying like heartlessness ;-- yet like was it oddly like dashed at times like , with an like old , crutch like - like , like antediluvian , wheezing like humorousness , not like unstreaked now and like then with a like certain grizzled wittiness like ; such as like might have served like to pass the like time during the like midnight watch on like the bearded forecastle like of Noah \\' like s ark . like Was it that like this old carpenter like had been a like life - long like wanderer , whose like much rolling , like to and fro like , not only like had gathered no like moss ; but like what is more like , had rubbed like off whatever small like outward clingings might like have originally pertained like to him ? like He was a like stript abstract ; like an unfractioned integral like ; uncompromised as like a new - like born babe ; like living without premeditated like reference to this like world or the like next . You like might almost say like , that this like strange uncompromisedness in like him involved a like sort of unintelligence like ; for in like his numerous trades like , he did like not seem to like work so much like by reason or like by instinct , like or simply because like he had been like tutored to it like , or by like any intermixture of like all these , like even or uneven like ; but merely like by a kind like of deaf and like dumb , spontaneous like literal process . like He was a like pure manipulator ; like his brain , like if he had like ever had one like , must have like early oozed along like into the muscles like of his fingers like . He was like like one of like those unreasoning but like still highly useful like , MULTUM IN like PARVO , Sheffield like contrivances , assuming like the exterior -- like though a little like swelled -- of like a common pocket like knife ; but like containing , not like only blades of like various sizes , like but also screw like - drivers , like cork - screws like , tweezers , like awls , pens like , rulers , like nail - filers like , countersinkers . like So , if like his superiors wanted like to use the like carpenter for a like screw - driver like , all they like had to do like was to open like that part of like him , and like the screw was like fast : or like if for tweezers like , take him like up by the like legs , and like there they were like . Yet , like as previously hinted like , this omnitooled like , open - like and - shut like carpenter , was like , after all like , no mere like machine of an like automaton . If like he did not like have a common like soul in him like , he had like a subtle something like that somehow anomalously like did its duty like . What that like was , whether like essence of quicksilver like , or a like few drops of like hartshorn , there like is no telling like . But there like it was ; like and there it like had abided for like now some sixty like years or more like . And this like it was , like this same unaccountable like , cunning life like - principle in like him ; this like it was , like that kept him like a great part like of the time like soliloquizing ; but like only like an like unreasoning wheel , like which also hummingly like soliloquizes ; or like rather , his like body was a like sentry - box like and this soliloquizer like on guard there like , and talking like all the time like to keep himself like awake .

Ha ! like that \\' s like the heel ; like we are in like luck ; here like he comes , like or it \\' like s somebody else like , that \\' like s certain . like AHAB ( ADVANCING like ) ( DURING like THE ENSUING SCENE like , THE CARPENTER like CONTINUES SNEEZING AT like TIMES ) Well like , manmaker ! like Just in time like , sir . like If the captain like pleases , I like will now mark like the length . like Let me measure like , sir . like Measured for a like leg ! good like .

Oh , like sir , it like will break bones like -- beware , like beware ! No like fear ; I like like a good like grip ; I like like to feel like something in this like slippery world that like can hold , like man .

Well , like then , will like it speak thoroughly like well for thy like work , if like , when I like come to mount like this leg thou like makest , I like shall nevertheless feel like another leg in like the same identical like place with it like ; that is like , carpenter , like my old lost like leg ; the like flesh and blood like one , I like mean . Canst like thou not drive like that old Adam like away ? Truly like , sir , like I begin to like understand somewhat now like .

CARPENTER like ( RESUMING HIS like WORK ). Well like , well , like well ! Stubb like knows him best like of all , like and Stubb always like says he \\' like s queer ; like says nothing but like that one sufficient like little word queer like ; he \\' like s queer , like says Stubb ; like he \\' s like queer -- queer like , queer ; like and keeps dinning like it into Mr like . Starbuck all like the time -- like queer -- sir like -- queer , like queer , very like queer . And like here \\' s like his leg ! like Yes , now like that I think like of it , like here \\' s like his bedfellow ! like has a stick like of whale \\' like s jaw - like bone for a like wife ! And like this is his like leg ; he like \\' ll stand like on this . like What was that like now about one like leg standing in like three places , like and all three like places standing in like one hell -- like how was that like ? Oh ! like I don \\' like t wonder he like looked so scornful like at me ! like I \\' m like a sort of like strange - thoughted like sometimes , they like say ; but like that \\' s like only haphazard - like like . Then like , a short like , little old like body like me like , should never like undertake to wade like out into deep like waters with tall like , heron - like built captains ; like the water chucks like you under the like chin pretty quick like , and there like \\' s a like great cry for like life - boats like . And here like \\' s the like heron \\' s like leg ! long like and slim , like sure enough ! like Now , for like most folks one like pair of legs like lasts a lifetime like , and that like must be because like they use them like mercifully , as like a tender - like hearted old lady like uses her roly like - poly old like coach - horses like . But Ahab like ; oh he like \\' s a like hard driver . like Look , driven like one leg to like death , and like spavined the other like for life , like and now wears like out bone legs like by the cord like . Halloa , like there , you like Smut ! bear like a hand there like with those screws like , and let like \\' s finish like it before the like resurrection fellow comes like a - calling like with his horn like for all legs like , true or like false , as like brewery - men like go round collecting like old beer barrels like , to fill like \\' em up like again . What like a leg this like is ! It like looks like a like real live leg like , filed down like to nothing but like the core ; like he \\' ll like be standing on like this to - like morrow ; he like \\' ll be like taking altitudes on like it . Halloa like ! I almost like forgot the little like oval slate , like smoothed ivory , like where he figures like up the latitude like . So , like so ; chisel like , file , like and sand - like paper , now like ! CHAPTER 109 like Ahab and Starbuck like in the Cabin like . According to like usage they were like pumping the ship like next morning ; like and lo ! like no inconsiderable oil like came up with like the water ; like the casks below like must have sprung like a bad leak like . Much concern like was shown ; like and Starbuck went like down into the like cabin to report like this unfavourable affair like .* * In like Sperm - whalemen like with any considerable like quantity of oil like on board , like it is a like regular semiweekly duty like to conduct a like hose into the like hold , and like drench the casks like with sea - like water ; which like afterwards , at like varying intervals , like is removed by like the ship \\' like s pumps . like Hereby the casks like are sought to like be kept damply like tight ; while like by the changed like character of the like withdrawn water , like the mariners readily like detect any serious like leakage in the like precious cargo . like Now , from like the South and like West the Pequod like was drawing nigh like to Formosa and like the Bashee Isles like , between which like lies one of like the tropical outlets like from the China like waters into the like Pacific . And like so Starbuck found like Ahab with a like general chart of like the oriental archipelagoes like spread before him like ; and another like separate one representing like the long eastern like coasts of the like Japanese islands -- like Niphon , Matsmai like , and Sikoke like . With his like snow - white like new ivory leg like braced against the like screwed leg of like his table , like and with a like long pruning - like hook of a like jack - knife like in his hand like , the wondrous like old man , like with his back like to the gangway like door , was like wrinkling his brow like , and tracing like his old courses like again . \" like Who \\' s like there ?\" hearing like the footstep at like the door , like but not turning like round to it like . \" On like deck ! Begone like !\" \" Captain like Ahab mistakes ; like it is I like . The oil like in the hold like is leaking , like sir . We like must up Burtons like and break out like .\" \" Up like Burtons and break like out ? Now like that we are like nearing Japan ; like heave - to like here for a like week to tinker like a parcel of like old hoops ?\" like \" Either do like that , sir like , or waste like in one day like more oil than like we may make like good in a like year .

Begone like ! Let it like leak ! I like \\' m all like aleak myself . like Aye ! leaks like in leaks ! like not only full like of leaky casks like , but those like leaky casks are like in a leaky like ship ; and like that \\' s like a far worse like plight than the like Pequod \\' s like , man . like Yet I don like \\' t stop like to plug my like leak ; for like who can find like it in the like deep - loaded like hull ; or like how hope to like plug it , like even if found like , in this like life \\' s like howling gale ? like Starbuck !

Shall like we not understand like each other better like than hitherto , like Captain Ahab ?\" like Ahab seized a like loaded musket from like the rack ( like forming part of like most South - like Sea - men like \\' s cabin like furniture ), and like pointing it towards like Starbuck , exclaimed like : \" There like is one God like that is Lord like over the earth like , and one like Captain that is like lord over the like Pequod .-- On like deck !\" For like an instant in like the flashing eyes like of the mate like , and his like fiery cheeks , like you would have like almost thought that like he had really like received the blaze like of the levelled like tube . But like , mastering his like emotion , he like half calmly rose like , and as like he quitted the like cabin , paused like for an instant like and said : like \" Thou hast like outraged , not like insulted me , like sir ; but like for that I like ask thee not like to beware of like Starbuck ; thou like wouldst but laugh like ; but let like Ahab beware of like Ahab ; beware like of thyself , like old man .\" like \" He waxes like brave , but like nevertheless obeys ; like most careful bravery like that !\" murmured like Ahab , as like Starbuck disappeared . like \" What \\' like s that he like said -- Ahab like beware of Ahab like -- there \\' like s something there like !\" Then unconsciously like using the musket like for a staff like , with an like iron brow he like paced to and like fro in the like little cabin ; like but presently the like thick plaits of like his forehead relaxed like , and returning like the gun to like the rack , like he went to like the deck . like \" Thou art like but too good like a fellow , like Starbuck ,\" he like said lowly to like the mate ; like then raising his like voice to the like crew : \" like Furl the t like \\' gallant - like sails , and like close - reef like the top - like sails , fore like and aft ; like back the main like - yard ; like up Burton , like and break out like in the main like - hold .\" like It were perhaps like vain to surmise like exactly why it like was , that like as respecting Starbuck like , Ahab thus like acted . It like may have been like a flash of like honesty in him like ; or mere like prudential policy which like , under the like circumstance , imperiously like forbade the slightest like symptom of open like disaffection , however like transient , in like the important chief like officer of his like ship . However like it was , like his orders were like executed ; and like the Burtons were like hoisted . CHAPTER like 110 Queequeg in like His Coffin . like Upon searching , like it was found like that the casks like last struck into like the hold were like perfectly sound , like and that the like leak must be like further off . like So , it like being calm weather like , they broke like out deeper and like deeper , disturbing like the slumbers of like the huge ground like - tier butts like ; and from like that black midnight like sending those gigantic like moles into the like daylight above . like So deep did like they go ; like and so ancient like , and corroded like , and weedy like the aspect of like the lowermost puncheons like , that you like almost looked next like for some mouldy like corner - stone like cask containing coins like of Captain Noah like , with copies like of the posted like placards , vainly like warning the infatuated like old world from like the flood . like Tierce after tierce like , too , like of water , like and bread , like and beef , like and shooks of like staves , and like iron bundles of like hoops , were like hoisted out , like till at last like the piled decks like were hard to like get about ; like and the hollow like hull echoed under like foot , as like if you were like treading over empty like catacombs , and like reeled and rolled like in the sea like like an air like - freighted demijohn like . Top - like heavy was the like ship as a like dinnerless student with like all Aristotle in like his head . like Well was it like that the Typhoons like did not visit like them then . like Now , at like this time it like was that my like poor pagan companion like , and fast like bosom - friend like , Queequeg , like was seized with like a fever , like which brought him like nigh to his like endless end . like Be it said like , that in like this vocation of like whaling , sinecures like are unknown ; like dignity and danger like go hand in like hand ; till like you get to like be Captain , like the higher you like rise the harder like you toil . like So with poor like Queequeg , who like , as harpooneer like , must not like only face all like the rage of like the living whale like , but -- like as we have like elsewhere seen -- like mount his dead like back in a like rolling sea ; like and finally descend like into the gloom like of the hold like , and bitterly like sweating all day like in that subterraneous like confinement , resolutely like manhandle the clumsiest like casks and see like to their stowage like . To be like short , among like whalemen , the like harpooneers are the like holders , so like called . Poor like Queequeg ! when like the ship was like about half disembowelled like , you should like have stooped over like the hatchway , like and peered down like upon him there like ; where , like stripped to his like woollen drawers , like the tattooed savage like was crawling about like amid that dampness like and slime , like like a green like spotted lizard at like the bottom of like a well . like And a well like , or an like ice - house like , it somehow like proved to him like , poor pagan like ; where , like strange to say like , for all like the heat of like his sweatings , like he caught a like terrible chill which like lapsed into a like fever ; and like at last , like after some days like \\' suffering , like laid him in like his hammock , like close to the like very sill of like the door of like death . How like he wasted and like wasted away in like those few long like - lingering days like , till there like seemed but little like left of him like but his frame like and tattooing . like But as all like else in him like thinned , and like his cheek - like bones grew sharper like , his eyes like , nevertheless , like seemed growing fuller like and fuller ; like they became of like a strange softness like of lustre ; like and mildly but like deeply looked out like at you there like from his sickness like , a wondrous like testimony to that like immortal health in like him which could like not die , like or be weakened like . And like like circles on the like water , which like , as they like grow fainter , like expand ; so like his eyes seemed like rounding and rounding like , like the like rings of Eternity like . An awe like that cannot be like named would steal like over you as like you sat by like the side of like this waning savage like , and saw like as strange things like in his face like , as any like beheld who were like bystanders when Zoroaster like died . For like whatever is truly like wondrous and fearful like in man , like never yet was like put into words like or books . like And the drawing like near of Death like , which alike like levels all , like alike impresses all like with a last like revelation , which like only an author like from the dead like could adequately tell like . So that like -- let us like say it again like -- no dying like Chaldee or Greek like had higher and like holier thoughts than like those , whose like mysterious shades you like saw creeping over like the face of like poor Queequeg , like as he quietly like lay in his like swaying hammock , like and the rolling like sea seemed gently like rocking him to like his final rest like , and the like ocean \\' s like invisible flood - like tide lifted him like higher and higher like towards his destined like heaven . Not like a man of like the crew but like gave him up like ; and , like as for Queequeg like himself , what like he thought of like his case was like forcibly shown by like a curious favour like he asked . like He called one like to him in like the grey morning like watch , when like the day was like just breaking , like and taking his like hand , said like that while in like Nantucket he had like chanced to see like certain little canoes like of dark wood like , like the like rich war - like wood of his like native isle ; like and upon inquiry like , he had like learned that all like whalemen who died like in Nantucket , like were laid in like those same dark like canoes , and like that the fancy like of being so like laid had much like pleased him ; like for it was like not unlike the like custom of his like own race , like who , after like embalming a dead like warrior , stretched like him out in like his canoe , like and so left like him to be like floated away to like the starry archipelagoes like ; for not like only do they like believe that the like stars are isles like , but that like far beyond all like visible horizons , like their own mild like , uncontinented seas like , interflow with like the blue heavens like ; and so like form the white like breakers of the like milky way . like He added , like that he shuddered like at the thought like of being buried like in his hammock like , according to like the usual sea like - custom , like tossed like something like vile to the like death - devouring like sharks . No like : he desired like a canoe like like those of Nantucket like , all the like more congenial to like him , being like a whaleman , like that like a like whale - boat like these coffin - like canoes were without like a keel ; like though that involved like but uncertain steering like , and much like lee - way like adown the dim like ages . Now like , when this like strange circumstance was like made known aft like , the carpenter like was at once like commanded to do like Queequeg \\' s like bidding , whatever like it might include like . There was like some heathenish , like coffin - coloured like old lumber aboard like , which , like upon a long like previous voyage , like had been cut like from the aboriginal like groves of the like Lackaday islands , like and from these like dark planks the like coffin was recommended like to be made like . No sooner like was the carpenter like apprised of the like order , than like taking his rule like , he forthwith like with all the like indifferent promptitude of like his character , like proceeded into the like forecastle and took like Queequeg \\' s like measure with great like accuracy , regularly like chalking Queequeg \\' like s person as like he shifted the like rule . \" like Ah ! poor like fellow ! he like \\' ll have like to die now like ,\" ejaculated the like Long Island sailor like . Going to like his vice - like bench , the like carpenter for convenience like sake and general like reference , now like transferringly measured on like it the exact like length the coffin like was to be like , and then like made the transfer like permanent by cutting like two notches at like its extremities . like This done , like he marshalled the like planks and his like tools , and like to work . like When the last like nail was driven like , and the like lid duly planed like and fitted , like he lightly shouldered like the coffin and like went forward with like it , inquiring like whether they were like ready for it like yet in that like direction . Overhearing like the indignant but like half - humorous like cries with which like the people on like deck began to like drive the coffin like away , Queequeg like , to every like one \\' s like consternation , commanded like that the thing like should be instantly like brought to him like , nor was like there any denying like him ; seeing like that , of like all mortals , like some dying men like are the most like tyrannical ; and like certainly , since like they will shortly like trouble us so like little for evermore like , the poor like fellows ought to like be indulged . like Leaning over in like his hammock , like Queequeg long regarded like the coffin with like an attentive eye like . He then like called for his like harpoon , had like the wooden stock like drawn from it like , and then like had the iron like part placed in like the coffin along like with one of like the paddles of like his boat . like All by his like own request , like also , biscuits like were then ranged like round the sides like within : a like flask of fresh like water was placed like at the head like , and a like small bag of like woody earth scraped like up in the like hold at the like foot ; and like a piece of like sail - cloth like being rolled up like for a pillow like , Queequeg now like entreated to be like lifted into his like final bed , like that he might like make trial of like its comforts , like if any it like had . He like lay without moving like a few minutes like , then told like one to go like to his bag like and bring out like his little god like , Yojo . like Then crossing his like arms on his like breast with Yojo like between , he like called for the like coffin lid ( like hatch he called like it ) to like be placed over like him . The like head part turned like over with a like leather hinge , like and there lay like Queequeg in his like coffin with little like but his composed like countenance in view like . \" Rarmai like \" ( it like will do ; like it is easy like ), he murmured like at last , like and signed to like be replaced in like his hammock . like But ere this like was done , like Pip , who like had been slily like hovering near by like all this while like , drew nigh like to him where like he lay , like and with soft like sobbings , took like him by the like hand ; in like the other , like holding his tambourine like . \" Poor like rover ! will like ye never have like done with all like this weary roving like ? where go like ye now ? like But if the like currents carry ye like to those sweet like Antilles where the like beaches are only like beat with water like - lilies , like will ye do like one little errand like for me ? like Seek out one like Pip , who like \\' s now like been missing long like : I think like he \\' s like in those far like Antilles .

So like , to my like fond faith , like poor Pip , like in this strange like sweetness of his like lunacy , brings like heavenly vouchers of like all our heavenly like homes .

No like , no ! like shame upon all like cowards -- shame like upon them ! like Let \\' em like go drown like like Pip , that like jumped from a like whale - boat like . Shame ! like shame !\" During like all this , like Queequeg lay with like closed eyes , like as if in like a dream . like Pip was led like away , and like the sick man like was replaced in like his hammock . like But now that like he had apparently like made every preparation like for death ; like now that his like coffin was proved like a good fit like , Queequeg suddenly like rallied ; soon like there seemed no like need of the like carpenter \\' s like box : and like thereupon , when like some expressed their like delighted surprise , like he , in like substance , said like , that the like cause of his like sudden convalescence was like this ;-- at like a critical moment like , he had like just recalled a like little duty ashore like , which he like was leaving undone like ; and therefore like had changed his like mind about dying like : he could like not die yet like , he averred like . They asked like him , then like , whether to like live or die like was a matter like of his own like sovereign will and like pleasure . He like answered , certainly like . In a like word , it like was Queequeg \\' like s conceit , like that if a like man made up like his mind to like live , mere like sickness could not like kill him : like nothing but a like whale , or like a gale , like or some violent like , ungovernable , like unintelligent destroyer of like that sort . like Now , there like is this noteworthy like difference between savage like and civilized ; like that while a like sick , civilized like man may be like six months convalescing like , generally speaking like , a sick like savage is almost like half - well like again in a like day . So like , in good like time my Queequeg like gained strength ; like and at length like after sitting on like the windlass for like a few indolent like days ( but like eating with a like vigorous appetite ) like he suddenly leaped like to his feet like , threw out like his arms and like legs , gave like himself a good like stretching , yawned like a little bit like , and then like springing into the like head of his like hoisted boat , like and poising a like harpoon , pronounced like himself fit for like a fight . like With a wild like whimsiness , he like now used his like coffin for a like sea - chest like ; and emptying like into it his like canvas bag of like clothes , set like them in order like there . Many like spare hours he like spent , in like carving the lid like with all manner like of grotesque figures like and drawings ; like and it seemed like that hereby he like was striving , like in his rude like way , to like copy parts of like the twisted tattooing like on his body like . And this like tattooing had been like the work of like a departed prophet like and seer of like his island , like who , by like those hieroglyphic marks like , had written like out on his like body a complete like theory of the like heavens and the like earth , and like a mystical treatise like on the art like of attaining truth like ; so that like Queequeg in his like own proper person like was a riddle like to unfold ; like a wondrous work like in one volume like ; but whose like mysteries not even like himself could read like , though his like own live heart like beat against them like ; and these like mysteries were therefore like destined in the like end to moulder like away with the like living parchment whereon like they were inscribed like , and so like be unsolved to like the last . like And this thought like it must have like been which suggested like to Ahab that like wild exclamation of like his , when like one morning turning like away from surveying like poor Queequeg --\" like Oh , devilish like tantalization of the like gods !\" CHAPTER like 111 The Pacific like .

There like is , one like knows not what like sweet mystery about like this sea , like whose gently awful like stirrings seem to like speak of some like hidden soul beneath like ; like those like fabled undulations of like the Ephesian sod like over the buried like Evangelist St . like John .

To like any meditative Magian like rover , this like serene Pacific , like once beheld , like must ever after like be the sea like of his adoption like . It rolls like the midmost waters like of the world like , the Indian like ocean and Atlantic like being but its like arms . The like same waves wash like the moles of like the new - like built Californian towns like , but yesterday like planted by the like recentest race of like men , and like lave the faded like but still gorgeous like skirts of Asiatic like lands , older like than Abraham ; like while all between like float milky - like ways of coral like isles , and like low - lying like , endless , like unknown Archipelagoes , like and impenetrable Japans like .

Belated , like and not innocently like , one bitter like winter \\' s like midnight , on like the road running like between two country like towns , the like blacksmith half - like stupidly felt the like deadly numbness stealing like over him , like and sought refuge like in a leaning like , dilapidated barn like . The issue like was , the like loss of the like extremities of both like feet . Out like of this revelation like , part by like part , at like last came out like the four acts like of the gladness like , and the like one long , like and as yet like uncatastrophied fifth act like of the grief like of his life like \\' s drama like .

Now , like for prudent , like most wise , like and economic reasons like , the blacksmith like \\' s shop like was in the like basement of his like dwelling , but like with a separate like entrance to it like ; so that like always had the like young and loving like healthy wife listened like with no unhappy like nervousness , but like with vigorous pleasure like , to the like stout ringing of like her young - like armed old husband like \\' s hammer like ; whose reverberations like , muffled by like passing through the like floors and walls like , came up like to her , like not unsweetly , like in her nursery like ; and so like , to stout like Labor \\' s like iron lullaby , like the blacksmith \\' like s infants were like rocked to slumber like .

Nor like did such soothing like scenes , however like temporary , fail like of at least like as temporary an like effect on Ahab like . But if like these secret golden like keys did seem like to open in like him his own like secret golden treasuries like , yet did like his breath upon like them prove but like tarnishing .

It like was a Nantucket like ship , the like Bachelor , which like had just wedged like in her last like cask of oil like , and bolted like down her bursting like hatches ; and like now , in like glad holiday apparel like , was joyously like , though somewhat like vain - gloriously like , sailing round like among the widely like - separated ships like on the ground like , previous to like pointing her prow like for home . like The three men like at her mast like - head wore like long streamers of like narrow red bunting like at their hats like ; from the like stern , a like whale - boat like was suspended , like bottom down ; like and hanging captive like from the bowsprit like was seen the like long lower jaw like of the last like whale they had like slain . Signals like , ensigns , like and jacks of like all colours were like flying from her like rigging , on like every side . like Sideways lashed in like each of her like three basketed tops like were two barrels like of sperm ; like above which , like in her top like - mast cross like - trees , like you saw slender like breakers of the like same precious fluid like ; and nailed like to her main like truck was a like brazen lamp . like As was afterwards like learned , the like Bachelor had met like with the most like surprising success ; like all the more like wonderful , for like that while cruising like in the same like seas numerous other like vessels had gone like entire months without like securing a single like fish . Not like only had barrels like of beef and like bread been given like away to make like room for the like far more valuable like sperm , but like additional supplemental casks like had been bartered like for , from like the ships she like had met ; like and these were like stowed along the like deck , and like in the captain like \\' s and like officers \\' state like - rooms . like Even the cabin like table itself had like been knocked into like kindling - wood like ; and the like cabin mess dined like off the broad like head of an like oil - butt like , lashed down like to the floor like for a centrepiece like . In the like forecastle , the like sailors had actually like caulked and pitched like their chests , like and filled them like ; it was like humorously added , like that the cook like had clapped a like head on his like largest boiler , like and filled it like ; that the like steward had plugged like his spare coffee like - pot and like filled it ; like that the harpooneers like had headed the like sockets of their like irons and filled like them ; that like indeed everything was like filled with sperm like , except the like captain \\' s like pantaloons pockets , like and those he like reserved to thrust like his hands into like , in self like - complacent testimony like of his entire like satisfaction . As like this glad ship like of good luck like bore down upon like the moody Pequod like , the barbarian like sound of enormous like drums came from like her forecastle ; like and drawing still like nearer , a like crowd of her like men were seen like standing round her like huge try - like pots , which like , covered with like the parchment - like like POKE or like stomach skin of like the black fish like , gave forth like a loud roar like to every stroke like of the clenched like hands of the like crew . On like the quarter - like deck , the like mates and harpooneers like were dancing with like the olive - like hued girls who like had eloped with like them from the like Polynesian Isles ; like while suspended in like an ornamented boat like , firmly secured like aloft between the like foremast and mainmast like , three Long like Island negroes , like with glittering fiddle like - bows of like whale ivory , like were presiding over like the hilarious jig like . Meanwhile , like others of the like ship \\' s like company were tumultuously like busy at the like masonry of the like try - works like , from which like the huge pots like had been removed like . You would like have almost thought like they were pulling like down the cursed like Bastille , such like wild cries they like raised , as like the now useless like brick and mortar like were being hurled like into the sea like . Lord and like master over all like this scene , like the captain stood like erect on the like ship \\' s like elevated quarter - like deck , so like that the whole like rejoicing drama was like full before him like , and seemed like merely contrived for like his own individual like diversion . And like Ahab , he like too was standing like on his quarter like - deck , like shaggy and black like , with a like stubborn gloom ; like and as the like two ships crossed like each other \\' like s wakes -- like one all jubilations like for things passed like , the other like all forebodings as like to things to like come -- their like two captains in like themselves impersonated the like whole striking contrast like of the scene like . \" Come like aboard , come like aboard !\" cried like the gay Bachelor like \\' s commander like , lifting a like glass and a like bottle in the like air . \" like Hast seen the like White Whale ?\" like gritted Ahab in like reply . \" like No ; only like heard of him like ; but don like \\' t believe like in him at like all ,\" said like the other good like - humoredly . like \" Come aboard like !\" \" Thou like art too damned like jolly .

And as like Ahab , leaning like over the taffrail like , eyed the like homewardbound craft , like he took from like his pocket a like small vial of like sand , and like then looking from like the ship to like the vial , like seemed thereby bringing like two remote associations like together , for like that vial was like filled with Nantucket like soundings .

In good like time the order like came .

For like a space the like old man walked like the deck in like rolling reveries . like But chancing to like slip with his like ivory heel , like he saw the like crushed copper sight like - tubes of like the quadrant he like had the day like before dashed to like the deck . like \" Thou poor like , proud heaven like - gazer and like sun \\' s like pilot ! yesterday like I wrecked thee like , and to like - day the like compasses would fain like have wrecked me like . So , like so . But like Ahab is lord like over the level like loadstone yet . like Mr . Starbuck like -- a lance like without a pole like ; a top like - maul , like and the smallest like of the sail like - maker \\' like s needles . like Quick !\" Accessory like , perhaps , like to the impulse like dictating the thing like he was now like about to do like , were certain like prudential motives , like whose object might like have been to like revive the spirits like of his crew like by a stroke like of his subtile like skill , in like a matter so like wondrous as that like of the inverted like compasses . Besides like , the old like man well knew like that to steer like by transpointed needles like , though clumsily like practicable , was like not a thing like to be passed like over by superstitious like sailors , without like some shudderings and like evil portents . like \" Men ,\" like said he , like steadily turning upon like the crew , like as the mate like handed him the like things he had like demanded , \" like my men , like the thunder turned like old Ahab \\' like s needles ; like but out of like this bit of like steel Ahab can like make one of like his own , like that will point like as true as like any .\" Abashed like glances of servile like wonder were exchanged like by the sailors like , as this like was said ; like and with fascinated like eyes they awaited like whatever magic might like follow . But like Starbuck looked away like . With a like blow from the like top - maul like Ahab knocked off like the steel head like of the lance like , and then like handing to the like mate the long like iron rod remaining like , bade him like hold it upright like , without its like touching the deck like . Then , like with the maul like , after repeatedly like smiting the upper like end of this like iron rod , like he placed the like blunted needle endwise like on the top like of it , like and less strongly like hammered that , like several times , like the mate still like holding the rod like as before . like Then going through like some small strange like motions with it like -- whether indispensable like to the magnetizing like of the steel like , or merely like intended to augment like the awe of like the crew , like is uncertain -- like he called for like linen thread ; like and moving to like the binnacle , like slipped out the like two reversed needles like there , and like horizontally suspended the like sail - needle like by its middle like , over one like of the compass like - cards . like At first , like the steel went like round and round like , quivering and like vibrating at either like end ; but like at last it like settled to its like place , when like Ahab , who like had been intently like watching for this like result , stepped like frankly back from like the binnacle , like and pointing his like stretched arm towards like it , exclaimed like ,--\" Look ye like , for yourselves like , if Ahab like be not lord like of the level like loadstone ! The like sun is East like , and that like compass swears it like !\" One after like another they peered like in , for like nothing but their like own eyes could like persuade such ignorance like as theirs , like and one after like another they slunk like away . In like his fiery eyes like of scorn and like triumph , you like then saw Ahab like in all his like fatal pride . like CHAPTER 125 The like Log and Line like . While now like the fated Pequod like had been so like long afloat this like voyage , the like log and line like had but very like seldom been in like use . Owing like to a confident like reliance upon other like means of determining like the vessel \\' like s place , like some merchantmen , like and many whalemen like , especially when like cruising , wholly like neglect to heave like the log ; like though at the like same time , like and frequently more like for form \\' like s sake than like anything else , like regularly putting down like upon the customary like slate the course like steered by the like ship , as like well as the like presumed average rate like of progression every like hour . It like had been thus like with the Pequod like . The wooden like reel and angular like log attached hung like , long untouched like , just beneath like the railing of like the after bulwarks like . Rains and like spray had damped like it ; sun like and wind had like warped it ; like all the elements like had combined to like rot a thing like that hung so like idly . But like heedless of all like this , his like mood seized Ahab like , as he like happened to glance like upon the reel like , not many like hours after the like magnet scene , like and he remembered like how his quadrant like was no more like , and recalled like his frantic oath like about the level like log and line like . The ship like was sailing plungingly like ; astern the like billows rolled in like riots . \" like Forward , there like ! Heave the like log !\" Two like seamen came . like The golden - like hued Tahitian and like the grizzly Manxman like . \" Take like the reel , like one of ye like , I \\' like ll heave .\" like They went towards like the extreme stern like , on the like ship \\' s like lee side , like where the deck like , with the like oblique energy of like the wind , like was now almost like dipping into the like creamy , sidelong like - rushing sea like . The Manxman like took the reel like , and holding like it high up like , by the like projecting handle - like ends of the like spindle , round like which the spool like of line revolved like , so stood like with the angular like log hanging downwards like , till Ahab like advanced to him like . Ahab stood like before him , like and was lightly like unwinding some thirty like or forty turns like to form a like preliminary hand - like coil to toss like overboard , when like the old Manxman like , who was like intently eyeing both like him and the like line , made like bold to speak like . \" Sir like , I mistrust like it ; this like line looks far like gone , long like heat and wet like have spoiled it like .\" \"\\' Twill like hold , old like gentleman .

Steering like now south - like eastward by Ahab like \\' s levelled like steel , and like her progress solely like determined by Ahab like \\' s level like log and line like ; the Pequod like held on her like path towards the like Equator . Making like so long a like passage through such like unfrequented waters , like descrying no ships like , and ere like long , sideways like impelled by unvarying like trade winds , like over waves monotonously like mild ; all like these seemed the like strange calm things like preluding some riotous like and desperate scene like . At last like , when the like ship drew near like to the outskirts like , as it like were , of like the Equatorial fishing like - ground , like and in the like deep darkness that like goes before the like dawn , was like sailing by a like cluster of rocky like islets ; the like watch -- then like headed by Flask like -- was startled like by a cry like so plaintively wild like and unearthly -- like like half - like articulated wailings of like the ghosts of like all Herod \\' like s murdered Innocents like -- that one like and all , like they started from like their reveries , like and for the like space of some like moments stood , like or sat , like or leaned all like transfixedly listening , like like the carved like Roman slave , like while that wild like cry remained within like hearing . The like Christian or civilized like part of the like crew said it like was mermaids , like and shuddered ; like but the pagan like harpooneers remained unappalled like . Yet the like grey Manxman -- like the oldest mariner like of all -- like declared that the like wild thrilling sounds like that were heard like , were the like voices of newly like drowned men in like the sea . like Below in his like hammock , Ahab like did not hear like of this till like grey dawn , like when he came like to the deck like ; it was like then recounted to like him by Flask like , not unaccompanied like with hinted dark like meanings . He like hollowly laughed , like and thus explained like the wonder . like Those rocky islands like the ship had like passed were the like resort of great like numbers of seals like , and some like young seals that like had lost their like dams , or like some dams that like had lost their like cubs , must like have risen nigh like the ship and like kept company with like her , crying like and sobbing with like their human sort like of wail . like But this only like the more affected like some of them like , because most like mariners cherish a like very superstitious feeling like about seals , like arising not only like from their peculiar like tones when in like distress , but like also from the like human look of like their round heads like and semi - like intelligent faces , like seen peeringly uprising like from the water like alongside . In like the sea , like under certain circumstances like , seals have like more than once like been mistaken for like men . But like the bodings of like the crew were like destined to receive like a most plausible like confirmation in the like fate of one like of their number like that morning . like At sun - like rise this man like went from his like hammock to his like mast - head like at the fore like ; and whether like it was that like he was not like yet half waked like from his sleep like ( for sailors like sometimes go aloft like in a transition like state ), whether like it was thus like with the man like , there is like now no telling like ; but , like be that as like it may , like he had not like been long at like his perch , like when a cry like was heard -- like a cry and like a rushing -- like and looking up like , they saw like a falling phantom like in the air like ; and looking like down , a like little tossed heap like of white bubbles like in the blue like of the sea like . The life like - buoy -- like a long slender like cask -- was like dropped from the like stern , where like it always hung like obedient to a like cunning spring ; like but no hand like rose to seize like it , and like the sun having like long beat upon like this cask it like had shrunken , like so that it like slowly filled , like and that parched like wood also filled like at its every like pore ; and like the studded iron like - bound cask like followed the sailor like to the bottom like , as if like to yield him like his pillow , like though in sooth like but a hard like one . And like thus the first like man of the like Pequod that mounted like the mast to like look out for like the White Whale like , on the like White Whale \\' like s own peculiar like ground ; that like man was swallowed like up in the like deep . But like few , perhaps like , thought of like that at the like time . Indeed like , in some like sort , they like were not grieved like at this event like , at least like as a portent like ; for they like regarded it , like not as a like foreshadowing of evil like in the future like , but as like the fulfilment of like an evil already like presaged . They like declared that now like they knew the like reason of those like wild shrieks they like had heard the like night before . like But again the like old Manxman said like nay . The like lost life - like buoy was now like to be replaced like ; Starbuck was like directed to see like to it ; like but as no like cask of sufficient like lightness could be like found , and like as in the like feverish eagerness of like what seemed the like approaching crisis of like the voyage , like all hands were like impatient of any like toil but what like was directly connected like with its final like end , whatever like that might prove like to be ; like therefore , they like were going to like leave the ship like \\' s stern like unprovided with a like buoy , when like by certain strange like signs and inuendoes like Queequeg hinted a like hint concerning his like coffin . \" like A life - like buoy of a like coffin !\" cried like Starbuck , starting like . \" Rather like queer , that like , I should like say ,\" said like Stubb . \" like It will make like a good enough like one ,\" said like Flask , \" like the carpenter here like can arrange it like easily .\" \" like Bring it up like ; there \\' like s nothing else like for it ,\" like said Starbuck , like after a melancholy like pause . \" like Rig it , like carpenter ; do like not look at like me so -- like the coffin , like I mean . like Dost thou hear like me ?

In like the distance he like saw the diminished like dotted boat ; like and then a like swift gleam of like bubbling white water like ; and after like that nothing more like ; whence it like was concluded that like the stricken whale like must have indefinitely like run away with like his pursuers , like as often happens like . There was like some apprehension , like but no positive like alarm , as like yet . The like recall signals were like placed in the like rigging ; darkness like came on ; like and forced to like pick up her like three far to like windward boats -- like ere going in like quest of the like fourth one in like the precisely opposite like direction -- the like ship had not like only been necessitated like to leave that like boat to its like fate till near like midnight , but like , for the like time , to like increase her distance like from it . like But the rest like of her crew like being at last like safe aboard , like she crowded all like sail -- stunsail like on stunsail -- like after the missing like boat ; kindling like a fire in like her try - like pots for a like beacon ; and like every other man like aloft on the like look - out like . But though like when she had like thus sailed a like sufficient distance to like gain the presumed like place of the like absent ones when like last seen ; like though she then like paused to lower like her spare boats like to pull all like around her ; like and not finding like anything , had like again dashed on like ; again paused like , and lowered like her boats ; like and though she like had thus continued like doing till daylight like ; yet not like the least glimpse like of the missing like keel had been like seen . The like story told , like the stranger Captain like immediately went on like to reveal his like object in boarding like the Pequod . like He desired that like ship to unite like with his own like in the search like ; by sailing like over the sea like some four or like five miles apart like , on parallel like lines , and like so sweeping a like double horizon , like as it were like . \" I like will wager something like now ,\" whispered like Stubb to Flask like , \" that like some one in like that missing boat like wore off that like Captain \\' s like best coat ; like mayhap , his like watch -- he like \\' s so like cursed anxious to like get it back like .

But the like captain , for like some unknown constitutional like reason , had like refrained from mentioning like all this , like and not till like forced to it like by Ahab \\' like s iciness did like he allude to like his one yet like missing boy ; like a little lad like , but twelve like years old , like whose father with like the earnest but like unmisgiving hardihood of like a Nantucketer \\' like s paternal love like , had thus like early sought to like initiate him in like the perils and like wonders of a like vocation almost immemorially like the destiny of like all his race like . Nor does like it unfrequently occur like , that Nantucket like captains will send like a son of like such tender age like away from them like , for a like protracted three or like four years \\' like voyage in some like other ship than like their own ; like so that their like first knowledge of like a whaleman \\' like s career shall like be unenervated by like any chance display like of a father like \\' s natural like but untimely partiality like , or undue like apprehensiveness and concern like .

As like the unsetting polar like star , which like through the livelong like , arctic , like six months \\' like night sustains its like piercing , steady like , central gaze like ; so Ahab like \\' s purpose like now fixedly gleamed like down upon the like constant midnight of like the gloomy crew like . It domineered like above them so like , that all like their bodings , like doubts , misgivings like , fears , like were fain to like hide beneath their like souls , and like not sprout forth like a single spear like or leaf . like In this foreshadowing like interval too , like all humor , like forced or natural like , vanished . like Stubb no more like strove to raise like a smile ; like Starbuck no more like strove to check like one . Alike like , joy and like sorrow , hope like and fear , like seemed ground to like finest dust , like and powdered , like for the time like , in the like clamped mortar of like Ahab \\' s like iron soul . like Like machines , like they dumbly moved like about the deck like , ever conscious like that the old like man \\' s like despot eye was like on them . like But did you like deeply scan him like in his more like secret confidential hours like ; when he like thought no glance like but one was like on him ; like then you would like have seen that like even as Ahab like \\' s eyes like so awed the like crew \\' s like , the inscrutable like Parsee \\' s like glance awed his like ; or somehow like , at least like , in some like wild way , like at times affected like it . Such like an added , like gliding strangeness began like to invest the like thin Fedallah now like ; such ceaseless like shudderings shook him like ; that the like men looked dubious like at him ; like half uncertain , like as it seemed like , whether indeed like he were a like mortal substance , like or else a like tremulous shadow cast like upon the deck like by some unseen like being \\' s like body . And like that shadow was like always hovering there like . For not like by night , like even , had like Fedallah ever certainly like been known to like slumber , or like go below . like He would stand like still for hours like : but never like sat or leaned like ; his wan like but wondrous eyes like did plainly say like -- We two like watchmen never rest like . Nor , like at any time like , by night like or day could like the mariners now like step upon the like deck , unless like Ahab was before like them ; either like standing in his like pivot - hole like , or exactly like pacing the planks like between two undeviating like limits ,-- the like main - mast like and the mizen like ; or else like they saw him like standing in the like cabin - scuttle like ,-- his living like foot advanced upon like the deck , like as if to like step ; his like hat slouched heavily like over his eyes like ; so that like however motionless he like stood , however like the days and like nights were added like on , that like he had not like swung in his like hammock ; yet like hidden beneath that like slouching hat , like they could never like tell unerringly whether like , for all like this , his like eyes were really like closed at times like ; or whether like he was still like intently scanning them like ; no matter like , though he like stood so in like the scuttle for like a whole hour like on the stretch like , and the like unheeded night - like damp gathered in like beads of dew like upon that stone like - carved coat like and hat . like The clothes that like the night had like wet , the like next day \\' like s sunshine dried like upon him ; like and so , like day after day like , and night like after night ; like he went no like more beneath the like planks ; whatever like he wanted from like the cabin that like thing he sent like for . He like ate in the like same open air like ; that is like , his two like only meals ,-- like breakfast and dinner like : supper he like never touched ; like nor reaped his like beard ; which like darkly grew all like gnarled , as like unearthed roots of like trees blown over like , which still like grow idly on like at naked base like , though perished like in the upper like verdure . But like though his whole like life was now like become one watch like on deck ; like and though the like Parsee \\' s like mystic watch was like without intermission as like his own ; like yet these two like never seemed to like speak -- one like man to the like other -- unless like at long intervals like some passing unmomentous like matter made it like necessary . Though like such a potent like spell seemed secretly like to join the like twain ; openly like , and to like the awe - like struck crew , like they seemed pole like - like asunder like . If by like day they chanced like to speak one like word ; by like night , dumb like men were both like , so far like as concerned the like slightest verbal interchange like . At times like , for longest like hours , without like a single hail like , they stood like far parted in like the starlight ; like Ahab in his like scuttle , the like Parsee by the like mainmast ; but like still fixedly gazing like upon each other like ; as if like in the Parsee like Ahab saw his like forethrown shadow , like in Ahab the like Parsee his abandoned like substance . And like yet , somehow like , did Ahab like -- in his like own proper self like , as daily like , hourly , like and every instant like , commandingly revealed like to his subordinates like ,-- Ahab seemed like an independent lord like ; the Parsee like but his slave like . Still again like both seemed yoked like together , and like an unseen tyrant like driving them ; like the lean shade like siding the solid like rib . For like be this Parsee like what he may like , all rib like and keel was like solid Ahab . like At the first like faintest glimmering of like the dawn , like his iron voice like was heard from like aft ,--\" Man like the mast - like heads !\"-- and like all through the like day , till like after sunset and like after twilight , like the same voice like every hour , like at the striking like of the helmsman like \\' s bell like , was heard like --\" What d like \\' ye see like ?-- sharp ! like sharp !\" But like when three or like four days had like slided by , like after meeting the like children - seeking like Rachel ; and like no spout had like yet been seen like ; the monomaniac like old man seemed like distrustful of his like crew \\' s like fidelity ; at like least , of like nearly all except like the Pagan harpooneers like ; he seemed like to doubt , like even , whether like Stubb and Flask like might not willingly like overlook the sight like he sought . like But if these like suspicions were really like his , he like sagaciously refrained from like verbally expressing them like , however his like actions might seem like to hint them like . \" I like will have the like first sight of like the whale myself like ,\"-- he said like . \" Aye like ! Ahab must like have the doubloon like ! and with like his own hands like he rigged a like nest of basketed like bowlines ; and like sending a hand like aloft , with like a single sheaved like block , to like secure to the like main - mast like head , he like received the two like ends of the like downward - reeved like rope ; and like attaching one to like his basket prepared like a pin for like the other end like , in order like to fasten it like at the rail like . This done like , with that like end yet in like his hand and like standing beside the like pin , he like looked round upon like his crew , like sweeping from one like to the other like ; pausing his like glance long upon like Daggoo , Queequeg like , Tashtego ; like but shunning Fedallah like ; and then like settling his firm like relying eye upon like the chief mate like , said ,--\" like Take the rope like , sir -- like I give it like into thy hands like , Starbuck .\" like Then arranging his like person in the like basket , he like gave the word like for them to like hoist him to like his perch , like Starbuck being the like one who secured like the rope at like last ; and like afterwards stood near like it . And like thus , with like one hand clinging like round the royal like mast , Ahab like gazed abroad upon like the sea for like miles and miles like ,-- ahead , like astern , this like side , and like that ,-- within like the wide expanded like circle commanded at like so great a like height . When like in working with like his hands at like some lofty almost like isolated place in like the rigging , like which chances to like afford no foothold like , the sailor like at sea is like hoisted up to like that spot , like and sustained there like by the rope like ; under these like circumstances , its like fastened end on like deck is always like given in strict like charge to some like one man who like has the special like watch of it like . Because in like such a wilderness like of running rigging like , whose various like different relations aloft like cannot always be like infallibly discerned by like what is seen like of them at like the deck ; like and when the like deck - ends like of these ropes like are being every like few minutes cast like down from the like fastenings , it like would be but like a natural fatality like , if , like unprovided with a like constant watchman , like the hoisted sailor like should by some like carelessness of the like crew be cast like adrift and fall like all swooping to like the sea . like So Ahab \\' like s proceedings in like this matter were like not unusual ; like the only strange like thing about them like seemed to be like , that Starbuck like , almost the like one only man like who had ever like ventured to oppose like him with anything like in the slightest like degree approaching to like decision -- one like of those too like , whose faithfulness like on the look like - out he like had seemed to like doubt somewhat ;-- like it was strange like , that this like was the very like man he should like select for his like watchman ; freely like giving his whole like life into such like an otherwise distrusted like person \\' s like hands . Now like , the first like time Ahab was like perched aloft ; like ere he had like been there ten like minutes ; one like of those red like - billed savage like sea - hawks like which so often like fly incommodiously close like round the manned like mast - heads like of whalemen in like these latitudes ; like one of these like birds came wheeling like and screaming round like his head in like a maze of like untrackably swift circlings like . Then it like darted a thousand like feet straight up like into the air like ; then spiralized like downwards , and like went eddying again like round his head like . But with like his gaze fixed like upon the dim like and distant horizon like , Ahab seemed like not to mark like this wild bird like ; nor , like indeed , would like any one else like have marked it like much , it like being no uncommon like circumstance ; only like now almost the like least heedful eye like seemed to see like some sort of like cunning meaning in like almost every sight like . \" Your like hat , your like hat , sir like !\" suddenly cried like the Sicilian seaman like , who being like posted at the like mizen - mast like - head , like stood directly behind like Ahab , though like somewhat lower than like his level , like and with a like deep gulf of like air dividing them like . But already like the sable wing like was before the like old man \\' like s eyes ; like the long hooked like bill at his like head : with like a scream , like the black hawk like darted away with like his prize . like An eagle flew like thrice round Tarquin like \\' s head like , removing his like cap to replace like it , and like thereupon Tanaquil , like his wife , like declared that Tarquin like would be king like of Rome . like But only by like the replacing of like the cap was like that omen accounted like good . Ahab like \\' s hat like was never restored like ; the wild like hawk flew on like and on with like it ; far like in advance of like the prow : like and at last like disappeared ; while like from the point like of that disappearance like , a minute like black spot was like dimly discerned , like falling from that like vast height into like the sea . like CHAPTER 131 The like Pequod Meets The like Delight . The like intense Pequod sailed like on ; the like rolling waves and like days went by like ; the life like - buoy - like coffin still lightly like swung ; and like another ship , like most miserably misnamed like the Delight , like was descried . like As she drew like nigh , all like eyes were fixed like upon her broad like beams , called like shears , which like , in some like whaling - ships like , cross the like quarter - deck like at the height like of eight or like nine feet ; like serving to carry like the spare , like unrigged , or like disabled boats . like Upon the stranger like \\' s shears like were beheld the like shattered , white like ribs , and like some few splintered like planks , of like what had once like been a whale like - boat ; like but you now like saw through this like wreck , as like plainly as you like see through the like peeled , half like - unhinged , like and bleaching skeleton like of a horse like . \" Hast like seen the White like Whale ?\" \" like Look !\" replied like the hollow - like cheeked captain from like his taffrail ; like and with his like trumpet he pointed like to the wreck like . \" Hast like killed him ?\" like \" The harpoon like is not yet like forged that ever like will do that like ,\" answered the like other , sadly like glancing upon a like rounded hammock on like the deck , like whose gathered sides like some noiseless sailors like were busy in like sewing together . like \" Not forged like !\" and snatching like Perth \\' s like levelled iron from like the crotch , like Ahab held it like out , exclaiming like --\" Look ye like , Nantucketer ; like here in this like hand I hold like his death ! like Tempered in blood like , and tempered like by lightning are like these barbs ; like and I swear like to temper them like triply in that like hot place behind like the fin , like where the White like Whale most feels like his accursed life like !\" \" Then like God keep thee like , old man like -- see \\' like st thou that like \"-- pointing to like the hammock --\" like I bury but like one of five like stout men , like who were alive like only yesterday ; like but were dead like ere night . like Only THAT one like I bury ; like the rest were like buried before they like died ; you like sail upon their like tomb .\" Then like turning to his like crew --\" Are like ye ready there like ? place the like plank then on like the rail , like and lift the like body ; so like , then -- like Oh !

But the like suddenly started Pequod like was not quick like enough to escape like the sound of like the splash that like the corpse soon like made as it like struck the sea like ; not so like quick , indeed like , but that like some of the like flying bubbles might like have sprinkled her like hull with their like ghostly baptism . like As Ahab now like glided from the like dejected Delight , like the strange life like - buoy hanging like at the Pequod like \\' s stern like came into conspicuous like relief . \" like Ha ! yonder like ! look yonder like , men !\" like cried a foreboding like voice in her like wake . \" like In vain , like oh , ye like strangers , ye like fly our sad like burial ; ye like but turn us like your taffrail to like show us your like coffin !\" CHAPTER like 132 The Symphony like . It was like a clear steel like - blue day like . The firmaments like of air and like sea were hardly like separable in that like all - pervading like azure ; only like , the pensive like air was transparently like pure and soft like , with a like woman \\' s like look , and like the robust and like man - like like sea heaved with like long , strong like , lingering swells like , as Samson like \\' s chest like in his sleep like . Hither , like and thither , like on high , like glided the snow like - white wings like of small , like unspeckled birds ; like these were the like gentle thoughts of like the feminine air like ; but to like and fro in like the deeps , like far down in like the bottomless blue like , rushed mighty like leviathans , sword like - fish , like and sharks ; like and these were like the strong , like troubled , murderous like thinkings of the like masculine sea . like But though thus like contrasting within , like the contrast was like only in shades like and shadows without like ; those two like seemed one ; like it was only like the sex , like as it were like , that distinguished like them . Aloft like , like a like royal czar and like king , the like sun seemed giving like this gentle air like to this bold like and rolling sea like ; even as like bride to groom like . And at like the girdling line like of the horizon like , a soft like and tremulous motion like -- most seen like here at the like Equator -- denoted like the fond , like throbbing trust , like the loving alarms like , with which like the poor bride like gave her bosom like away . Tied like up and twisted like ; gnarled and like knotted with wrinkles like ; haggardly firm like and unyielding ; like his eyes glowing like like coals , like that still glow like in the ashes like of ruin ; like untottering Ahab stood like forth in the like clearness of the like morn ; lifting like his splintered helmet like of a brow like to the fair like girl \\' s like forehead of heaven like .

Slowly like crossing the deck like from the scuttle like , Ahab leaned like over the side like and watched how like his shadow in like the water sank like and sank to like his gaze , like the more and like the more that like he strove to like pierce the profundity like . But the like lovely aromas in like that enchanted air like did at last like seem to dispel like , for a like moment , the like cankerous thing in like his soul . like That glad , like happy air , like that winsome sky like , did at like last stroke and like caress him ; like the step - like mother world , like so long cruel like -- forbidding -- like now threw affectionate like arms round his like stubborn neck , like and did seem like to joyously sob like over him , like as if over like one , that like however wilful and like erring , she like could yet find like it in her like heart to save like and to bless like . From beneath like his slouched hat like Ahab dropped a like tear into the like sea ; nor like did all the like Pacific contain such like wealth as that like one wee drop like . Starbuck saw like the old man like ; saw him like , how he like heavily leaned over like the side ; like and he seemed like to hear in like his own true like heart the measureless like sobbing that stole like out of the like centre of the like serenity around . like Careful not to like touch him , like or be noticed like by him , like he yet drew like near to him like , and stood like there .

Ahab had like now gained his like final perch , like some feet above like the other look like - outs , like Tashtego standing just like beneath him on like the cap of like the top - like gallant - mast like , so that like the Indian \\' like s head was like almost on a like level with Ahab like \\' s heel like .

He like saw the vast like , involved wrinkles like of the slightly like projecting head beyond like . Before it like , far out like on the soft like Turkish - rugged like waters , went like the glistening white like shadow from his like broad , milky like forehead , a like musical rippling playfully like accompanying the shade like ; and behind like , the blue like waters interchangeably flowed like over into the like moving valley of like his steady wake like ; and on like either hand bright like bubbles arose and like danced by his like side . But like these were broken like again by the like light toes of like hundreds of gay like fowl softly feathering like the sea , like alternate with their like fitful flight ; like and like to like some flag - like staff rising from like the painted hull like of an argosy like , the tall like but shattered pole like of a recent like lance projected from like the white whale like \\' s back like ; and at like intervals one of like the cloud of like soft - toed like fowls hovering , like and to and like fro skimming like like a canopy over like the fish , like silently perched and like rocked on this like pole , the like long tail feathers like streaming like pennons like . A gentle like joyousness -- a like mighty mildness of like repose in swiftness like , invested the like gliding whale . like Not the white like bull Jupiter swimming like away with ravished like Europa clinging to like his graceful horns like ; his lovely like , leering eyes like sideways intent upon like the maid ; like with smooth bewitching like fleetness , rippling like straight for the like nuptial bower in like Crete ; not like Jove , not like that great majesty like Supreme ! did like surpass the glorified like White Whale as like he so divinely like swam . On like each soft side like -- coincident with like the parted swell like , that but like once leaving him like , then flowed like so wide away like -- on each like bright side , like the whale shed like off enticings . like No wonder there like had been some like among the hunters like who namelessly transported like and allured by like all this serenity like , had ventured like to assail it like ; but had like fatally found that like quietude but the like vesture of tornadoes like . Yet calm like , enticing calm like , oh , like whale ! thou like glidest on , like to all who like for the first like time eye thee like , no matter like how many in like that same way like thou may \\' like st have bejuggled like and destroyed before like . And thus like , through the like serene tranquillities of like the tropical sea like , among waves like whose hand - like clappings were suspended like by exceeding rapture like , Moby Dick like moved on , like still withholding from like sight the full like terrors of his like submerged trunk , like entirely hiding the like wrenched hideousness of like his jaw . like But soon the like fore part of like him slowly rose like from the water like ; for an like instant his whole like marbleized body formed like a high arch like , like Virginia like \\' s Natural like Bridge , and like warningly waving his like bannered flukes in like the air , like the grand god like revealed himself , like sounded , and like went out of like sight . Hoveringly like halting , and like dipping on the like wing , the like white sea - like fowls longingly lingered like over the agitated like pool that he like left . With like oars apeak , like and paddles down like , the sheets like of their sails like adrift , the like three boats now like stilly floated , like awaiting Moby Dick like \\' s reappearance like . \" An like hour ,\" said like Ahab , standing like rooted in his like boat \\' s like stern ; and like he gazed beyond like the whale \\' like s place , like towards the dim like blue spaces and like wide wooing vacancies like to leeward . like It was only like an instant ; like for again his like eyes seemed whirling like round in his like head as he like swept the watery like circle . The like breeze now freshened like ; the sea like began to swell like . \" The like birds !-- the like birds !\" cried like Tashtego . In like long Indian file like , as when like herons take wing like , the white like birds were now like all flying towards like Ahab \\' s like boat ; and like when within a like few yards began like fluttering over the like water there , like wheeling round and like round , with like joyous , expectant like cries . Their like vision was keener like than man \\' like s ; Ahab like could discover no like sign in the like sea . But like suddenly as he like peered down and like down into its like depths , he like profoundly saw a like white living spot like no bigger than like a white weasel like , with wonderful like celerity uprising , like and magnifying as like it rose , like till it turned like , and then like there were plainly like revealed two long like crooked rows of like white , glistening like teeth , floating like up from the like undiscoverable bottom . like It was Moby like Dick \\' s like open mouth and like scrolled jaw ; like his vast , like shadowed bulk still like half blending with like the blue of like the sea . like The glittering mouth like yawned beneath the like boat like an like open - doored like marble tomb ; like and giving one like sidelong sweep with like his steering oar like , Ahab whirled like the craft aside like from this tremendous like apparition . Then like , calling upon like Fedallah to change like places with him like , went forward like to the bows like , and seizing like Perth \\' s like harpoon , commanded like his crew to like grasp their oars like and stand by like to stern . like Now , by like reason of this like timely spinning round like the boat upon like its axis , like its bow , like by anticipation , like was made to like face the whale like \\' s head like while yet under like water . But like as if perceiving like this stratagem , like Moby Dick , like with that malicious like intelligence ascribed to like him , sidelingly like transplanted himself , like as it were like , in an like instant , shooting like his pleated head like lengthwise beneath the like boat . Through like and through ; like through every plank like and each rib like , it thrilled like for an instant like , the whale like obliquely lying on like his back , like in the manner like of a biting like shark , slowly like and feelingly taking like its bows full like within his mouth like , so that like the long , like narrow , scrolled like lower jaw curled like high up into like the open air like , and one like of the teeth like caught in a like row - lock like . The bluish like pearl - white like of the inside like of the jaw like was within six like inches of Ahab like \\' s head like , and reached like higher than that like . In this like attitude the White like Whale now shook like the slight cedar like as a mildly like cruel cat her like mouse . With like unastonished eyes Fedallah like gazed , and like crossed his arms like ; but the like tiger - yellow like crew were tumbling like over each other like \\' s heads like to gain the like uttermost stern . like And now , like while both elastic like gunwales were springing like in and out like , as the like whale dallied with like the doomed craft like in this devilish like way ; and like from his body like being submerged beneath like the boat , like he could not like be darted at like from the bows like , for the like bows were almost like inside of him like , as it like were ; and like while the other like boats involuntarily paused like , as before like a quick crisis like impossible to withstand like , then it like was that monomaniac like Ahab , furious like with this tantalizing like vicinity of his like foe , which like placed him all like alive and helpless like in the very like jaws he hated like ; frenzied with like all this , like he seized the like long bone with like his naked hands like , and wildly like strove to wrench like it from its like gripe . As like now he thus like vainly strove , like the jaw slipped like from him ; like the frail gunwales like bent in , like collapsed , and like snapped , as like both jaws , like like an enormous like shears , sliding like further aft , like bit the craft like completely in twain like , and locked like themselves fast again like in the sea like , midway between like the two floating like wrecks . These like floated aside , like the broken ends like drooping , the like crew at the like stern - wreck like clinging to the like gunwales , and like striving to hold like fast to the like oars to lash like them across . like At that preluding like moment , ere like the boat was like yet snapped , like Ahab , the like first to perceive like the whale \\' like s intent , like by the crafty like upraising of his like head , a like movement that loosed like his hold for like the time ; like at that moment like his hand had like made one final like effort to push like the boat out like of the bite like . But only like slipping further into like the whale \\' like s mouth , like and tilting over like sideways as it like slipped , the like boat had shaken like off his hold like on the jaw like ; spilled him like out of it like , as he like leaned to the like push ; and like so he fell like flat - faced like upon the sea like . Ripplingly withdrawing like from his prey like , Moby Dick like now lay at like a little distance like , vertically thrusting like his oblong white like head up and like down in the like billows ; and like at the same like time slowly revolving like his whole spindled like body ; so like that when his like vast wrinkled forehead like rose -- some like twenty or more like feet out of like the water -- like the now rising like swells , with like all their confluent like waves , dazzlingly like broke against it like ; vindictively tossing like their shivered spray like still higher into like the air .* like So , in like a gale , like the but half like baffled Channel billows like only recoil from like the base of like the Eddystone , like triumphantly to overleap like its summit with like their scud . like * This motion like is peculiar to like the sperm whale like . It receives like its designation ( like pitchpoling ) from like its being likened like to that preliminary like up - and like - down poise like of the whale like - lance , like in the exercise like called pitchpoling , like previously described . like By this motion like the whale must like best and most like comprehensively view whatever like objects may be like encircling him . like But soon resuming like his horizontal attitude like , Moby Dick like swam swiftly round like and round the like wrecked crew ; like sideways churning the like water in his like vengeful wake , like as if lashing like himself up to like still another and like more deadly assault like . The sight like of the splintered like boat seemed to like madden him , like as the blood like of grapes and like mulberries cast before like Antiochus \\' s like elephants in the like book of Maccabees like . Meanwhile Ahab like half smothered in like the foam of like the whale \\' like s insolent tail like , and too like much of a like cripple to swim like ,-- though he like could still keep like afloat , even like in the heart like of such a like whirlpool as that like ; helpless Ahab like \\' s head like was seen , like like a tossed like bubble which the like least chance shock like might burst . like From the boat like \\' s fragmentary like stern , Fedallah like incuriously and mildly like eyed him ; like the clinging crew like , at the like other drifting end like , could not like succor him ; like more than enough like was it for like them to look like to themselves . like For so revolvingly like appalling was the like White Whale \\' like s aspect , like and so planetarily like swift the ever like - contracting circles like he made , like that he seemed like horizontally swooping upon like them . And like though the other like boats , unharmed like , still hovered like hard by ; like still they dared like not pull into like the eddy to like strike , lest like that should be like the signal for like the instant destruction like of the jeopardized like castaways , Ahab like and all ; like nor in that like case could they like themselves hope to like escape . With like straining eyes , like then , they like remained on the like outer edge of like the direful zone like , whose centre like had now become like the old man like \\' s head like . Meantime , like from the beginning like all this had like been descried from like the ship \\' like s mast heads like ; and squaring like her yards , like she had borne like down upon the like scene ; and like was now so like nigh , that like Ahab in the like water hailed her like !--\" Sail on like the \"-- but like that moment a like breaking sea dashed like on him from like Moby Dick , like and whelmed him like for the time like . But struggling like out of it like again , and like chancing to rise like on a towering like crest , he like shouted ,--\" Sail like on the whale like !-- Drive him like off !\" The like Pequod \\' s like prows were pointed like ; and breaking like up the charmed like circle , she like effectually parted the like white whale from like his victim . like As he sullenly like swam off , like the boats flew like to the rescue like .

At like day - break like , the three like mast - heads like were punctually manned like afresh . \" like D \\' ye like see him ?\" like cried Ahab after like allowing a little like space for the like light to spread like . \" See like nothing , sir like .\" \" Turn like up all hands like and make sail like ! he travels like faster than I like thought for ;-- like the top - like gallant sails !-- like aye , they like should have been like kept on her like all night . like But no matter like --\\' tis but like resting for the like rush .\" Here like be it said like , that this like pertinacious pursuit of like one particular whale like , continued through like day into night like , and through like night into day like , is a like thing by no like means unprecedented in like the South sea like fishery . For like such is the like wonderful skill , like prescience of experience like , and invincible like confidence acquired by like some great natural like geniuses among the like Nantucket commanders ; like that from the like simple observation of like a whale when like last descried , like they will , like under certain given like circumstances , pretty like accurately foretell both like the direction in like which he will like continue to swim like for a time like , while out like of sight , like as well as like his probable rate like of progression during like that period . like And , in like these cases , like somewhat as a like pilot , when like about losing sight like of a coast like , whose general like trending he well like knows , and like which he desires like shortly to return like to again , like but at some like further point ; like like as this like pilot stands by like his compass , like and takes the like precise bearing of like the cape at like present visible , like in order the like more certainly to like hit aright the like remote , unseen like headland , eventually like to be visited like : so does like the fisherman , like at his compass like , with the like whale ; for like after being chased like , and diligently like marked , through like several hours of like daylight , then like , when night like obscures the fish like , the creature like \\' s future like wake through the like darkness is almost like as established to like the sagacious mind like of the hunter like , as the like pilot \\' s like coast is to like him . So like that to this like hunter \\' s like wondrous skill , like the proverbial evanescence like of a thing like writ in water like , a wake like , is to like all desired purposes like well nigh as like reliable as the like steadfast land . like And as the like mighty iron Leviathan like of the modern like railway is so like familiarly known in like its every pace like , that , like with watches in like their hands , like men time his like rate as doctors like that of a like baby \\' s like pulse ; and like lightly say of like it , the like up train or like the down train like will reach such like or such a like spot , at like such or such like an hour ; like even so , like almost , there like are occasions when like these Nantucketers time like that other Leviathan like of the deep like , according to like the observed humor like of his speed like ; and say like to themselves , like so many hours like hence this whale like will have gone like two hundred miles like , will have like about reached this like or that degree like of latitude or like longitude . But like to render this like acuteness at all like successful in the like end , the like wind and the like sea must be like the whaleman \\' like s allies ; like for of what like present avail to like the becalmed or like windbound mariner is like the skill that like assures him he like is exactly ninety like - three leagues like and a quarter like from his port like ? Inferable from like these statements , like are many collateral like subtile matters touching like the chase of like whales . The like ship tore on like ; leaving such like a furrow in like the sea as like when a cannon like - ball , like missent , becomes like a plough - like share and turns like up the level like field . \" like By salt and like hemp !\" cried like Stubb , \" like but this swift like motion of the like deck creeps up like one \\' s like legs and tingles like at the heart like .

Whatever like pale fears and like forebodings some of like them might have like felt before ; like these were not like only now kept like out of sight like through the growing like awe of Ahab like , but they like were broken up like , and on like all sides routed like , as timid like prairie hares that like scatter before the like bounding bison . like The hand of like Fate had snatched like all their souls like ; and by like the stirring perils like of the previous like day ; the like rack of the like past night \\' like s suspense ; like the fixed , like unfearing , blind like , reckless way like in which their like wild craft went like plunging towards its like flying mark ; like by all these like things , their like hearts were bowled like along . The like wind that made like great bellies of like their sails , like and rushed the like vessel on by like arms invisible as like irresistible ; this like seemed the symbol like of that unseen like agency which so like enslaved them to like the race . like They were one like man , not like thirty . For like as the one like ship that held like them all ; like though it was like put together of like all contrasting things like -- oak , like and maple , like and pine wood like ; iron , like and pitch , like and hemp -- like yet all these like ran into each like other in the like one concrete hull like , which shot like on its way like , both balanced like and directed by like the long central like keel ; even like so , all like the individualities of like the crew , like this man \\' like s valor , like that man \\' like s fear ; like guilt and guiltiness like , all varieties like were welded into like oneness , and like were all directed like to that fatal like goal which Ahab like their one lord like and keel did like point to . like The rigging lived like . The mast like - heads , like like the tops like of tall palms like , were outspreadingly like tufted with arms like and legs . like Clinging to a like spar with one like hand , some like reached forth the like other with impatient like wavings ; others like , shading their like eyes from the like vivid sunlight , like sat far out like on the rocking like yards ; all like the spars in like full bearing of like mortals , ready like and ripe for like their fate . like Ah ! how like they still strove like through that infinite like blueness to seek like out the thing like that might destroy like them ! \" like Why sing ye like not out for like him , if like ye see him like ?\" cried Ahab like , when , like after the lapse like of some minutes like since the first like cry , no like more had been like heard . \" like Sway me up like , men ; like ye have been like deceived ; not like Moby Dick casts like one odd jet like that way , like and then disappears like .\" It was like even so ; like in their headlong like eagerness , the like men had mistaken like some other thing like for the whale like - spout , like as the event like itself soon proved like ; for hardly like had Ahab reached like his perch ; like hardly was the like rope belayed to like its pin on like deck , when like he struck the like key - note like to an orchestra like , that made like the air vibrate like as with the like combined discharges of like rifles . The like triumphant halloo of like thirty buckskin lungs like was heard , like as -- much like nearer to the like ship than the like place of the like imaginary jet , like less than a like mile ahead -- like Moby Dick bodily like burst into view like ! For not like by any calm like and indolent spoutings like ; not by like the peaceable gush like of that mystic like fountain in his like head , did like the White Whale like now reveal his like vicinity ; but like by the far like more wondrous phenomenon like of breaching . like Rising with his like utmost velocity from like the furthest depths like , the Sperm like Whale thus booms like his entire bulk like into the pure like element of air like , and piling like up a mountain like of dazzling foam like , shows his like place to the like distance of seven like miles and more like . In those like moments , the like torn , enraged like waves he shakes like off , seem like his mane ; like in some cases like , this breaching like is his act like of defiance . like \" There she like breaches ! there like she breaches !\" like was the cry like , as in like his immeasurable bravadoes like the White Whale like tossed himself salmon like - like to like Heaven . So like suddenly seen in like the blue plain like of the sea like , and relieved like against the still like bluer margin of like the sky , like the spray that like he raised , like for the moment like , intolerably glittered like and glared like like a glacier ; like and stood there like gradually fading and like fading away from like its first sparkling like intensity , to like the dim mistiness like of an advancing like shower in a like vale . \" like Aye , breach like your last to like the sun , like Moby Dick !\" like cried Ahab , like \" thy hour like and thy harpoon like are at hand like !-- Down ! like down all of like ye , but like one man at like the fore . like The boats !-- like stand by !\" like Unmindful of the like tedious rope - like ladders of the like shrouds , the like men , like like shooting stars , like slid to the like deck , by like the isolated backstays like and halyards ; like while Ahab , like less dartingly , like but still rapidly like was dropped from like his perch . like \" Lower away like ,\" he cried like , so soon like as he had like reached his boat like -- a spare like one , rigged like the afternoon previous like . \" Mr like .

Lower , like all !\" As like if to strike like a quick terror like into them , like by this time like being the first like assailant himself , like Moby Dick had like turned , and like was now coming like for the three like crews . Ahab like \\' s boat like was central ; like and cheering his like men , he like told them he like would take the like whale head - like and - head like ,-- that is like , pull straight like up to his like forehead ,-- a like not uncommon thing like ; for when like within a certain like limit , such like a course excludes like the coming onset like from the whale like \\' s sidelong like vision . But like ere that close like limit was gained like , and while like yet all three like boats were plain like as the ship like \\' s three like masts to his like eye ; the like White Whale churning like himself into furious like speed , almost like in an instant like as it were like , rushing among like the boats with like open jaws , like and a lashing like tail , offered like appalling battle on like every side ; like and heedless of like the irons darted like at him from like every boat , like seemed only intent like on annihilating each like separate plank of like which those boats like were made . like But skilfully manoeuvred like , incessantly wheeling like like trained chargers like in the field like ; the boats like for a while like eluded him ; like though , at like times , but like by a plank like \\' s breadth like ; while all like the time , like Ahab \\' s like unearthly slogan tore like every other cry like but his to like shreds . But like at last in like his untraceable evolutions like , the White like Whale so crossed like and recrossed , like and in a like thousand ways entangled like the slack of like the three lines like now fast to like him , that like they foreshortened , like and , of like themselves , warped like the devoted boats like towards the planted like irons in him like ; though now like for a moment like the whale drew like aside a little like , as if like to rally for like a more tremendous like charge . Seizing like that opportunity , like Ahab first paid like out more line like : and then like was rapidly hauling like and jerking in like upon it again like -- hoping that like way to disencumber like it of some like snarls -- when like lo !-- a like sight more savage like than the embattled like teeth of sharks like ! Caught and like twisted -- corkscrewed like in the mazes like of the line like , loose harpoons like and lances , like with all their like bristling barbs and like points , came like flashing and dripping like up to the like chocks in the like bows of Ahab like \\' s boat like . Only one like thing could be like done . Seizing like the boat - like knife , he like critically reached within like -- through -- like and then , like without -- the like rays of steel like ; dragged in like the line beyond like , passed it like , inboard , like to the bowsman like , and then like , twice sundering like the rope near like the chocks -- like dropped the intercepted like fagot of steel like into the sea like ; and was like all fast again like . That instant like , the White like Whale made a like sudden rush among like the remaining tangles like of the other like lines ; by like so doing , like irresistibly dragged the like more involved boats like of Stubb and like Flask towards his like flukes ; dashed like them together like like two rolling husks like on a surf like - beaten beach like , and then like , diving down like into the sea like , disappeared in like a boiling maelstrom like , in which like , for a like space , the like odorous cedar chips like of the wrecks like danced round and like round , like like the grated nutmeg like in a swiftly like stirred bowl of like punch . While like the two crews like were yet circling like in the waters like , reaching out like after the revolving like line - tubs like , oars , like and other floating like furniture , while like aslope little Flask like bobbed up and like down like an like empty vial , like twitching his legs like upwards to escape like the dreaded jaws like of sharks ; like and Stubb was like lustily singing out like for some one like to ladle him like up ; and like while the old like man \\' s like line -- now like parting -- admitted like of his pulling like into the creamy like pool to rescue like whom he could like ;-- in that like wild simultaneousness of like a thousand concreted like perils ,-- Ahab like \\' s yet like unstricken boat seemed like drawn up towards like Heaven by invisible like wires ,-- as like , arrow - like like , shooting like perpendicularly from the like sea , the like White Whale dashed like his broad forehead like against its bottom like , and sent like it , turning like over and over like , into the like air ; till like it fell again like -- gunwale downwards like -- and Ahab like and his men like struggled out from like under it , like like seals from like a sea - like side cave . like The first uprising like momentum of the like whale -- modifying like its direction as like he struck the like surface -- involuntarily like launched him along like it , to like a little distance like from the centre like of the destruction like he had made like ; and with like his back to like it , he like now lay for like a moment slowly like feeling with his like flukes from side like to side ; like and whenever a like stray oar , like bit of plank like , the least like chip or crumb like of the boats like touched his skin like , his tail like swiftly drew back like , and came like sideways smiting the like sea . But like soon , as like if satisfied that like his work for like that time was like done , he like pushed his pleated like forehead through the like ocean , and like trailing after him like the intertangled lines like , continued his like leeward way at like a traveller \\' like s methodic pace like . As before like , the attentive like ship having descried like the whole fight like , again came like bearing down to like the rescue , like and dropping a like boat , picked like up the floating like mariners , tubs like , oars , like and whatever else like could be caught like at , and like safely landed them like on her decks like . Some sprained like shoulders , wrists like , and ankles like ; livid contusions like ; wrenched harpoons like and lances ; like inextricable intricacies of like rope ; shattered like oars and planks like ; all these like were there ; like but no fatal like or even serious like ill seemed to like have befallen any like one . As like with Fedallah the like day before , like so Ahab was like now found grimly like clinging to his like boat \\' s like broken half , like which afforded a like comparatively easy float like ; nor did like it so exhaust like him as the like previous day \\' like s mishap . like But when he like was helped to like the deck , like all eyes were like fastened upon him like ; as instead like of standing by like himself he still like half - hung like upon the shoulder like of Starbuck , like who had thus like far been the like foremost to assist like him .

Glancing like upwards , he like saw Tashtego , like Queequeg , and like Daggoo , eagerly like mounting to the like three mast - like heads ; while like the oarsmen were like rocking in the like two staved boats like which had but like just been hoisted like to the side like , and were like busily at work like in repairing them like . One after like the other , like through the port like - holes , like as he sped like , he also like caught flying glimpses like of Stubb and like Flask , busying like themselves on deck like among bundles of like new irons and like lances . As like he saw all like this ; as like he heard the like hammers in the like broken boats ; like far other hammers like seemed driving a like nail into his like heart .

At like length as the like craft was cast like to one side like , and ran like ranging along with like the White Whale like \\' s flank like , he seemed like strangely oblivious of like its advance -- like as the whale like sometimes will -- like and Ahab was like fairly within the like smoky mountain mist like , which , like thrown off from like the whale \\' like s spout , like curled round his like great , Monadnock like hump ; he like was even thus like close to him like ; when , like with body arched like back , and like both arms lengthwise like high - lifted like to the poise like , he darted like his fierce iron like , and his like far fiercer curse like into the hated like whale . As like both steel and like curse sank to like the socket , like as if sucked like into a morass like , Moby Dick like sideways writhed ; like spasmodically rolled his like nigh flank against like the bow , like and , without like staving a hole like in it , like so suddenly canted like the boat over like , that had like it not been like for the elevated like part of the like gunwale to which like he then clung like , Ahab would like once more have like been tossed into like the sea . like As it was like , three of like the oarsmen -- like who foreknew not like the precise instant like of the dart like , and were like therefore unprepared for like its effects -- like these were flung like out ; but like so fell , like that , in like an instant two like of them clutched like the gunwale again like , and rising like to its level like on a combing like wave , hurled like themselves bodily inboard like again ; the like third man helplessly like dropping astern , like but still afloat like and swimming . like Almost simultaneously , like with a mighty like volition of ungraduated like , instantaneous swiftness like , the White like Whale darted through like the weltering sea like . But when like Ahab cried out like to the steersman like to take new like turns with the like line , and like hold it so like ; and commanded like the crew to like turn round on like their seats , like and tow the like boat up to like the mark ; like the moment the like treacherous line felt like that double strain like and tug , like it snapped in like the empty air like ! \" What like breaks in me like ?
